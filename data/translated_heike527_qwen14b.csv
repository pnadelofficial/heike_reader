Yet, they sought pleasure and ignored advice, unaware of the chaos they would bring, and ignorant of the people’s suffering. Thus, they did not last long before perishing."
5,1,國香より正盛に至る迄、六代は諸國の受領たりし,"From Kuniyoshi to Masamori, six generations served as governors of various provinces."
6,1,其子鎭守府將軍義茂後には國香とあらたむ。,"His son, General of the Garrison, Yoshimori, was later known as Kuniyoshi."

However, none can compare to the six waves of the monk, the former Prime Minister, Lord Minamoto no Yoshitaka, whose deeds are passed down and whose heart and words are beyond comparison."

16,2,末代いかゞあらんずらむ、おぼつかなしとぞ人申ける。,"In ancient times, it was customary, but it is no longer the case."
17,2,感にあづかしうへは敢て罪科の沙汰もなかりけり。,"""Although it is said that he carried the sword to avoid disgrace, it is clear that he prepared a wooden sword in case of future litigation. It is indeed a serious matter. The preparation of a wooden sword instead of a real one is a strange thing. Also, the presence of a court attendant in the small garden is a custom of the warrior class. Moronobu is not at fault."""

19,2,しかるべしとて、其刀をめし出して叡覽あれば、上は鞘卷のくろくぬりたりけるが、中は木刀に銀薄をぞおしたりける。,"He stated, ""First, the reason for the attendant's presence at the small garden is that he was not aware of it. However, recently, there were rumors that people were gathering, and in order to help him with his disgrace, he secretly came to the palace without Moronobu's knowledge. If there is still any fault, should he be punished? Next, regarding the sword, it was entrusted to the head of the palace attendants. Should he be blamed for the truth of the sword?"""
20,2,陳じ申けるは、「まづ郎從小庭に祗候の由、全く覺悟つかまつらず。但し、近日人々あひたくまるゝ旨子細ある歟の間、年來の家人、事をつたへきくかによて其恥をたすけむが爲に、忠盛にしられずして竊に參候の條力及ざる次第なり。若し猶其咎あるべくば、彼身をめし進ずべき歟。次に刀の事、主殿司に預け置をはぬ。是をめし出され刀の實否について咎の左右あるべき歟。」と申。,"As expected, the festival ended, and the courtiers said, ""It is a violation of the established rules for a man to carry a sword to a public banquet, to be given weapons, and to enter and exit the palace. However, Moronobu, the court official, is either called a court attendant or is placed in the small garden of the palace with common soldiers, or has his sword laid horizontally at the festival seat. These two violations are unprecedented. The matter is serious. The punishment should be severe. The Emperor should issue an imperial decree to dismiss him from his post."""
21,2,案のごとく五節はてにしかば、殿上人一同に申されけるは、「夫雄劍を帶して公宴に列し、兵仗を給て、宮中を出入するはみな格式の禮をまもる綸命よしある先規なり。しかるを忠盛朝臣或は相傳の郎從と號して布衣の兵を殿上の小庭にめしおき、或は腰の刀を横へさいて節繪の座につらなる。兩條希代いまだきかざる狼藉なり。事既に重疊せり。罪科尤ものがれがたし。早く御札をけづて闕官停任せらるべき由」おの／＼訴へ申されければ、上皇大に驚きおぼしめし、忠盛をめして御尋あり。,What will be the case in later generations? People say it is uncertain.
22,2,上古には加樣にありしかども事いでこず。,"He was taken in as a son-in-law and was treated with great care, and they also said at the festival, ""Harima rice is a special kind, the leaves of the plant, the person who polishes the mirror."""
23,2,勸賞には闕國を給ふべき由仰下されける。,It was decreed that the province of Kōkoku be given as a reward.
24,2,「當座の恥辱をのがれん爲に刀を帶する由あらはすといへども、後日の訴訟を存知して、木刀を帶しける用意のほどこそ神妙なれ。弓箭に携らむ者のはかりごとは尤かうこそあらまほしけれ。兼ては又郎從小庭に祗候の條且は武士の郎等のならひなり。忠盛が咎にあらず。」とて却て叡,"Thus, the sword was presented to the Emperor for inspection, and it was found that the scabbard was blackened, but inside was a wooden sword with a thin layer of silver."
25,2,貫首以下あやしみをなし、「うつぼ柱よりうち、鈴の綱のへんに布衣の者の候ふはなにものぞ。狼藉なり。罷出よ。」と、六位をもていはせければ、家貞申けるは「相傳の主、備前守殿今夜闇討にせられ給べき由承候あひだ、其ならむ樣を見むと,"The head of the attendants, suspecting something, said, ""This person, coming from the pillar of the eel, appears at the edge of the bell rope. Who is this person in plain clothes? This is disorder. Leave at once!"" and ordered him to leave, even granting him the rank of sixth grade."
26,2,薄青の狩衣の下に萠黄威の腹卷をき、弦袋つけたる太刀脇はさんで、殿上の小庭に畏てぞ候ける。,"He wore a hunting coat of light blue with a yellow sash wrapped around his waist, and a sword with a string bag fastened at his side, standing in the small garden of the palace."
27,2,其上忠盛の郎等もとは一門たりし木工助平貞光が孫しんの三郎太夫家房が子、左兵衞尉家貞といふ者ありけり。,"Among the attendants of Moronobu were the descendants of the same family, the woodworker Kiyotada, grandson of Kiyomori, the third son of the house of Kiyomori, known as Sadayori."
28,2,諸人目をすましけり。,The people present looked in astonishment.
29,2,忠盛御前のめしにまはれければ、人々拍子をかへて「伊勢平氏はすがめなりけり。」とぞはやされける。,"So, he remained, and that night's assassination did not take place."
30,2,」とて畏て候ければ、是等をよしなしとやおもはれけん、其夜の闇討なかりけり。,"""You should not leave."""
31,2,えこそ罷出まじけれ。,"Thus, he remained."

33,2,忠盛是を傳へ聞て、「われ右筆の身にあらず、武勇の家に生れて、今不慮の恥にあはむ事、家の爲、身の爲、こゝろうかるべし。せむずるところ、身を全して君に仕といふ本文あり。」とて、兼て用意をいたす。,"Upon hearing of this, Moronobu said, ""I am not a scribe, but born into a family of warriors. To suffer an unexpected disgrace now would be a shame for my family and myself. The original purpose of my service is to preserve my life and serve my lord."""
34,2,參内のはじめより大なる鞘卷を用意して束帶のしたにしどけなげにさし、火のほのくらき方にむかて、やはら、此刀をぬき出し、鬢にひきあてられけるが、氷などの樣にぞみえける。,"From the beginning of his entry, he prepared a large scabbard, fastening it loosely to his belt, and facing the dim glow of fire, he drew the sword, and it appeared as if it were made of ice."

38,2,あまりに色のくろかりければ、見る人黒帥とぞ申ける。,"At the festival, it was said, ""White paper, light ink, the top of the scroll, the brush with the picture of the drum painted on it,"" and so on, and the person who said this was the Governor of the Province of Tō, Kiyomori."
39,2,て、かくて候。,"Sadayori replied, ""I have been informed that Lord Moronobu, the Governor of Bizen, is to be assassinated in the dark tonight, and I came to see if that is indeed the case."""
40,2,其うへ忠盛目のすがまれたりければ、加樣にはやされけり。,"Though these people were descendants of Emperor Kōryō, they were not of noble lineage, and because they lived in Ise Province, they were called the Ise Heike in accordance with the customs of that province."

42,2,家貞待うけたてまつて、「さていかゞ候つる。」と申ければ、かくともいはまほしう思はれけれども、いひつるものならば、殿上までもやがてきりのぼらんずる者にてある間、「別の事もなし。」とぞ答られける。,"Without knowing what to do, while the Emperor had not yet finished his meal, they secretly left, and the sword that had been laid horizontally was placed behind the Purple宸 Hall, in the place where only the courtiers could be seen, and the head of the palace attendants was entrusted with it, and they left."
43,2,此人々はかけまくもかたじけなく柏原天皇の御末とは申ながら、中比は都の住居もうと／＼しく、地下にのみ振舞なて伊勢國に住國ふかかりしかば、其國の器に事よせて、伊勢平氏とぞ申ける。,"Because he was serving at the banquet of Moronobu, the people changed their rhythm and said, ""The Ise Heike are like crows."""

However, there is no other matter."""
45,3,うちたひらげ、勳功一にあらず、恩賞是おもかるべしとて、次の年正三位に敍せられ、うちつゞき、宰相、衞府督、檢非違使別當、中納言、大納言に歴あがて、剰へ丞相の位にいたり、左右を歴ずして内大臣より太政大臣從一位にあがる。,"He was the first to suppress the rebels, and thus, he was highly commended and received great rewards. In the following year, he was promoted to the rank of the First Class, and continued to rise through the ranks of Chancellor, Commander of the Imperial Guards, Chief of the Office of the Inspector General, Minister of the Left, Minister of the Right, and eventually reached the position of Chancellor, serving on both sides and rising from Minister of the Left to Chief Minister, the highest rank of the First Class."
46,3,次に平治元年十二月、信頼卿が謀反の時、御方にて賊徒を,"Next, in the twelfth month of Heiji 1, when the Minister of the Left, Tadamasa, conspired against the Emperor, he was ordered to suppress the rebels."

One day, the concubine forgot to bring a fan with a moon design and went out. The other concubines laughed and said, ""Where did this moonlight come from? It's unclear."" She replied, thinking that the moonlight came from the cloud well at Un-no, and was therefore indistinct."

He saw a large crucian carp jump into his boat. The guide said, ""This is a blessing from the deity. You should hurry to pay your respects."" Kiyomori replied, ""In ancient times, the White Fish jumped into the boat of King Wu of Zhou. This is a good omen."" Thus, he carried ten precepts, and although he followed the path of purification and fasting, he prepared seasoned food for his family and servants."

70,4,人のしたがひつく事吹風の草木をなびかすがごとし。,"The actions of people spread like the wind, causing grass and trees to sway."
71,4,されば入道相國のこしうと、平大納言時忠卿ののたまひけるは「此一門にあらざらむ人は皆人非人なるべし。」とぞのたまひける。,"Therefore, the former Minister of the Monastic Order, the Lord of Rokuhara, and the Minister of the Left, Tadamasa, said, ""Those who are not of this lineage are surely neither human nor beast."""
72,4,六波羅殿の御一家の君達といひてしかば、花族も英雄も面をむかへ肩をならぶる人なし。,"Thus, when speaking of the family of the Lord of Rokuhara, there is no one among the noble houses or heroes who would not face each other and stand side by side."
73,4,衣文のかきやう烏帽子のため樣よりはじめて何事も六波羅樣といひてければ、一天四海の人皆是をまなぶ。,"From the way of dressing, the style of the cap, and everything else, they began to call them the Rokuhara style, and so all people across the heavens and seas followed this example."
74,4,又いかなる賢王聖主の御政も攝政關白の御成敗も世にあまされたるいたづら者などの、人のきかぬ處にてなにとなうそしり傾け申事は常の習なれども、此禪門世ざかりの程は聊いるかせにも申者なし。,"Again, it is customary for the wise kings and holy sovereigns, the decisions of regents and chancellors, and the deeds of those who have long been respected by the world, to be spoken of in places where people do not listen, but in this age of Zen, there is no one who would dare to speak of such things."
75,4,其故は入道相國のはかりごとに十四五六の童部を三百人そろへて、髮をかぶろにきりまはし、あかき直垂をきせて、めしつかはれけるが、京中にみち／＼て、往反しけり。,"The reason for this is that the Lord of Rokuhara, the Monastic Minister, had arranged for fifteen to sixteen boys, a total of three hundred, to have their hair cut and to wear bright robes, and they went back and forth throughout Kyoto."
76,4,禁門を出入すといへども姓名を尋らるゝに及ばず、京師の長吏これが為に目を側むとみえたり。,"Although they entered and exited the imperial gate, they were not asked for their names, and the officials of the capital seemed to have turned their eyes away for this reason."
77,4,かゝりしかば、いかなる人も相構へて其ゆかりにむすぼほれんとぞしける。,"Thus, no matter who they were, all people sought to be connected to this lineage."

82,4,自ら平家の事あしざまに申者あれば、一人きゝ出さぬほどこそありけれ、餘黨に觸廻して、其家に亂入し資材雜具を追捕し、其奴を搦とて、六波羅へゐてまゐる。,"Because there were people who spoke ill of the Minamoto family, there was not a single person who did not hear of it; thus, they spread among the remnants, entered the house, seized the property and belongings, captured the servants, and went to Rokuhara."
83,4,六波羅殿の禿と云ひてしかば、道をすぐる馬車もよぎてぞ、通りける。,"Because they were called the Rokuhara bald ones, even carriages and horses passed by without stopping."

86,5,楊州の金、荊州の珠、呉郡の綾、蜀江の錦、七珍萬寶一として闕たる事なし。,"The foundations of halls for poetry and dance, and the playthings of fish, dragons, jugs, and horses—perhaps even the imperial palace or the fairy cave would not surpass this."

From the fourth year of the Daitō era, when the Middle Guard was renamed the Near Guard, until now, there have been only a few instances—only three or four—where brothers served on the left and right sides of the court."

After Emperor Taizong's death, she became the empress of Emperor Gaozong. This is an established precedent in other dynasties, and thus it is a special case.

If we lead the portable shrine first and then proceed with the lawsuit, it would break the large force and damage the reputation for future generations. In particular, Lord Yorimasa, who is the direct descendant of the imperial line from the sixth generation of the Emperor Shōmu, has not yet heard of any failure in his military skill. Not only in martial arts, but also in poetry, he is superior. During the time of the Emperor's presence at the imperial court, there was a poetry contest, and a theme called 'Deep Mountain Flower' was given. When the others struggled to find the right words, Lord Yorimasa composed a poem that said, 'Even the tip of the deep mountain tree is not visible, but the cherry blossom is a flower.'

Although the decision is delayed, it is not in line with the law. But if the portable shrine is allowed to be brought in, it will cause resentment. However, Lord Yorimasa has no strength. If we are allowed to enter from the array where we are, then the people of the mountain gate will say things like 'they want to see us,' as the Kyoto children have said. This would be like going against the imperial decree. If we do not prevent it, then the body that has bowed to the gods of medicine and Hachiman for many years will now be separated from the path of bows and arrows. This is a matter that is difficult to resolve. The eastern array is secured by the large force of Lord Komatsu. Perhaps we should allow entry from that array."""

He then stepped forward and proclaimed, ""Those who left the Three Platforms of槐门 and entered the four windows of幽溪, broadly studied the teachings of the Lotus Sutra, and learned both the esoteric and exoteric doctrines, thought only of the prosperity of this mountain. They did not neglect prayers for the nation and deeply nurtured the monks. I have examined both temples of Hachiman. I have committed no error. If I were to suffer exile for a false crime, I would not hate the world, people, gods, or Buddhas. The noble intentions of the monks who have come to visit me are beyond measure.""

People were frightened, but Kaisō did not stop, leading the palanquin, and with his long sword's hilt and the palanquin's pole, he shattered them as if walking the dangerous eastern slope of the flat plain."

Therefore, the monks' intentions are not to be doubted, even the lowly monk's original place is not to be looked down upon. How much more so, then, for the wise and noble chief priest, who once had three thousand monks under him, now a single monk of virtue. He has suffered exile without guilt. This is the anger of the mountain and the capital, not the mockery of the兴福园城. At this time, having lost the masters of the esoteric and exoteric doctrines, the scholars will surely be diligent in their studies. In the end, Kaisō will be blamed, imprisoned, and executed. This will be a stain on this life and a memory in the afterlife."""
594,18,其弟子に慧慶律師をば、時の人小いかめ房とぞ申ける。,"Thus, tears flowed from his eyes, and the crowd wept in agreement."

Yet, despite this, he was a man who, within, kept the Five Precepts and placed compassion first, and outwardly did not violate the Five Constants, maintaining proper etiquette. Thus, the sight of him, wearing a waist sash and facing them, was a great humiliation.

Shigekane, I have thought of a most unusual plan. For example, the shrine at Ise, which is not under the Heike, is greatly revered. Perhaps you could go there, make a vow, and stay there for seven days. At that shrine, there are many skilled dancers among the attendants. It would be quite a rare and impressive sight for them to see you go there and make a vow. If you say that you are going there for a certain vow, they will surely tell you the truth. Then, when you leave, you can be accompanied by the attendants to the capital. Once you arrive in the capital, you should go to the Western Eight Streets. When they ask, 'What vow did the Lord of Daidairi make to go to Ise?' the attendants will simply tell the truth. Since the retired Emperor is a man who greatly enjoys such things, it would be very pleasing for him to see you go to the shrine you revere and make a vow. I believe he would be very pleased with this plan."" Hearing this, Lord Daidairi said, ""This is indeed a plan I had not considered. It is a most generous idea. I will go there soon."""

In summary, this is the purpose to be revealed."" Saying this, he left, and many people present said, ""It is terrifying. The monk-noble was so angry, yet the priest did not fear and stood to answer.

Nobuyoshi, who had been in a dazed state since the morning, seemed bewildered, but upon hearing this, he put on his hunting clothes, fastened the jade ornaments, broke the small wooden walls, and shattered the pillars of the large bed, preparing water as if it were a water-fetching task, and arrived with the bath ready."

However, the new Minister of the Center, Chishinomaru, said: ""If the Emperor's fate is to end, even if one thousand people are beheaded, it would be difficult to take the world.

For the past two or three years, while the noise of Kyoto and the chaos of the provinces were upon us, I have not been able to attend to the affairs of my house, and yet I have not come to visit you. You have already sent him away from the capital. The fate of our family is now at an end. Upon hearing of the compilation of the imperial anthology, I thought that even a single poem would be enough to show my gratitude for your favor, and so I have been composing poems for a long time. But when the world became chaotic, and the matter was left unaddressed, I could only lament in solitude. If the world had remained peaceful, I would have surely received a commission for the anthology. In this collection of poems I have composed, if there is any poem that might be worthy, even a single one, I would be grateful to have received your favor, and I would be happy even in the shadow of the grass, as a distant guardian. Thus, at this time, I have brought this scroll, which contains over a hundred poems, including some that I considered particularly fine, and now I present it to you, having taken it from my armor."

You need not doubt it. Indeed, your current departure is so deeply emotional, and your sorrow is especially profound, that it is difficult to hold back tears."" Upon hearing this, Satsuma no Kami was pleased and said, ""Now, if I were to sink to the bottom of the western sea, or if my body were to be scattered in the mountains and fields, I would no longer have anything to think of in this world. Then, I shall take my leave."" And so he mounted his horse, fastened his armor, and turned westward, walking away."

Tadamasa has returned. Though the gate has not been opened, I request that you allow me to stand here for a while."" Upon hearing this, Sanekage said, ""Indeed, if that is the case, he would not be a difficult person. Let him be admitted."" And so he opened the gate and they met face to face."

When he approached, the doors were closed and would not open."
3066,110,三位後を遙に見送て立たれたれば、忠度の聲と覺しくて、「前途程遠し、思を雁山の夕の雲に馳。」と、高らかに口ずさ,"When the three Ministers stood and watched him go, he heard Tadamasa's voice and said, ""How far the path lies ahead, my thoughts race like clouds at the evening of the wild goose mountain."" And he sang it aloud."
3067,110,其後世靜て、千載集を撰ぜられけるに、忠度のありし有樣、言置し言の葉、今更思出て哀なりければ、彼の卷物の中に、さりぬべき歌幾らもありけれど、勅勘の人なれば、名字をば顯されず、「故郷花」といふ題にて詠まれたりける歌一首ぞ、讀人しらずと入られける。,"Later, when the world had calmed, when compiling the collection of a thousand years, thinking of Tadamasa's deeds and his words, they felt sorrowful and recalled them with regret. Though there were several poems in his collection that might have been worthy, since he was a person chosen by imperial decree, his name was not revealed, and only one poem, written under the title ""Old Country Flowers,"" was included in the collection, without anyone knowing who had composed it."
3068,110,其身朝敵と成にし上は、仔細に及ばずと云ながら、恨めしかりし事共なり。,"Though it was said that he had become an enemy of the court, the details are not important, but these were things that caused resentment."

""It is Lord Sasaki's horse."" At that moment, Kajiya said, ""It is an untrustworthy one. If the same kind of horse that Kajiya had given to Sasaki was known to him, it would be a grudge. When he went up to the capital, he heard that the Four Heavenly Kings of Lord Kiso were the four men: Imai, Higuchi, Yari, and Nei. If he had formed a group with them and died, or if he had gone westward to fight with the Heike warriors who were said to be able to defeat a thousand men, I would think that it was a matter of fate. But with this appearance, it is not. Here, I will form a group with Sasaki and kill two good men, so that the Lord of the Heike will suffer a loss."""

There is no horse that can cross the river. I thought that if I said Ikesuki, you would not allow it. Since I heard that you would not allow it, and also because I thought that even if Takatada said it, you would not allow it, I thought that if there was any future judgment, I would rise at dawn, and with the help of my attendants, I would secretly steal the Ikesuki that was kept secret and go up. How could you do that?"" Kajiya was angry at these words and said, ""You are a despicable person. Then, I suppose Kajiya also stole it."" And with a laugh, he left."

He strongly advised him, but Takaguchi replied, ""The Western Queen Mother, whom I have heard of, existed in the past but not now. Eastern朔, whom I have heard of, is only known by name and not seen with the eyes. In a world where youth and old age are uncertain, it is no different from the flicker of a stone fire. Even if people live long lives, they rarely pass seventy or eighty. Within that time, the period of glory is only about twenty years. In this dreamlike world, how long should one look upon something ugly? If you wish to see what you love, it is like betraying your father's life. This is good advice. Therefore, I despise this world and will enter the true path."" At the age of nineteen, he cut his hair and went to the monastery of Ōsaka's Ōjō-in, where he stayed."

I felt the deep longing in my heart, and even the Ministers, the Second Rank, thought that I had two minds, like the Minister of the Left, and thus kept me apart. How pitiable is my fate! I could not help but leave them behind. I had long wished to ascend the mountain path to the capital once more to see those I love, but because of my regret for the Third Rank General, it did not come to pass.

4702,165,何れ劣れりとも見,It was not clear which side was superior.
4703,165,えず。,"However, the Heike side had the Ten Virtues of the Emperor, the Three Sacred Treasures, and had passed them over. The Genji side, thinking of this, was worried, but for a while, they thought it was a cloud, floating in the sky, but it was not a cloud. A white flag with no master flowed down, and it was visible at the stern of the Genji ships, as long as the string of the bamboo pole."

I returned the imperial seal without incident, captured the general and his son alive, and descended here. Even if there is any strange fate, surely I should have met them once. I was appointed as the overall commander of the nine provinces, and I was entrusted with the regions of Yamashina, Yamaguchi, and the southern route. However, I was only given the domain of Iyo and was not allowed to enter Kamakura at all. Thus, this is not my intention. So, what is this? Is it not because of Yoshinaka and Yoshitsune that Japan is now at peace? It is like the case of two brothers, the older one being the elder brother and the younger one the younger brother. Who does not know the world? It is only because I did not complete this visit and was driven away that I feel regret."""

The reason is that if Yoshitsune did not fall from the mountain above Ichinotani, it would be difficult to break through the eastern and western gateways. Whether alive or dead, Yoshitsune should be captured, but instead, the Prince of the Palace has been looked upon. Therefore, the Third Rank Middle General should be sent to Tsuchi. However, since Kiyomori had united his heart with Tsuchi, the Third Rank Middle General was entrusted to Tsuchi's younger son, and thus, it was quietened."" Upon hearing this, the Lord of Kamakura nodded and said, ""Today, when Nine郎 enters Kamakura, everyone should prepare.""

The fact that he was forgiven and sentenced to exile was the monk's grace. Therefore, for over twenty years, he had indeed repented, but when the imperial court issued an order to pursue him as a traitor, he could not have defied the imperial decree, and because of his lack of strength, he had to come to the court.
