1,5,近く本朝をうかがふに、承平の將門、天慶の純友、康和の義親、平治の信頼、此等はおごれる心もたけき事も皆とりどりにこそありしかども、まぢかくは六波羅の入道、前太政大臣平朝臣清盛公と申し人のありさま、傳へうけたまはるこそ心も詞も及ばれね。,"Closer to our own nation: Tadami of Jōhei, Junnai of Tengyō, Yoshitada of Kōwa,信赖 of Heiji—though each had their pride and prowess in abundance, none compare to the likes of Hōgen's priest Ryōben and former Chancellor Minamoto no Kiyomori. Their tales, passed down through generations, transcend ordinary understanding."
1,6,其先祖を尋ぬれば、桓武天皇第五の皇子、一品式部卿葛原親王九代の後胤讃岐守正盛が孫、刑部卿忠盛朝臣の嫡男なり。,"Tracing his lineage: He is the ninth-generation descendant of Prince Karihara, Minister of Ceremonies, fifth son of Emperor Kanmu. Grandson of Sanemori, Lord of Sanuki, and legitimate son of Tadamasa Ason, Minister of Justice."
1,7,彼親王の御子、高親王無官無位にして、うせ給ひぬ。,"The prince's own son, High Prince Takakuni, held no court rank or position and passed away."
1,8,其御子高望の王の時始めて平の姓を給て、上總介になり給しより、忽に王氏を出て人臣につらなる。,"When High Prince Takamochi was granted the surname Minamoto, becoming Assistant Governor of Kazusa Province, suddenly members of the imperial line emerged to serve as subjects."
1,9,其子鎮守府將軍義茂後には國香とあらたむ。,"His son Yoshimori, Lord Commander of the Pacification Headquarters, was succeeded by Kunika."

2,5,忠盛三十六にて始て昇殿す。,"At age thirty-six, Tadamori first ascended the palace hall."
2,6,雲の上人是を嫉み、同き年の十一月廿三日、五節豐明の節會の夜、忠盛を闇討にせむとぞ擬せられける。,"Kumonosu no Jōja, envious of him, planned to assassinate Tadamori on November 23rd of the same year during the night of the Gosechi Festival's丰明祭 (Toyouke-no-Matsuri)."
2,7,忠盛是を傳へ聞て、「われ右筆の身にあらず、武勇の家に生れて、今不慮の恥にあはむ事、家の爲、身のために、こゝろかるべし。せむずるところ、身を全して君に仕といふ本文あり。」とて、兼て用意をいたす。,"Upon hearing this, Tadamori declared: 'Though not a scholar, I was born into a house of martial valor. To avoid dishonor to my family and myself, I must act. Even if it means death, my duty is to serve the lord.' He prepared accordingly."
2,8,参内のはじめより大なる鞘卷を用意して束帯のしたにしどけなげにさし、火のほのくらき方にむかて、やはら、此刀をぬき出し、鬢にひきあてられけるが、氷などの様にぞみえける。,"From the start of his audience, he wore a large sashimaki (armor) beneath his court attire.

2,11,薄青の狩衣の下に萠黄威の腹巻をき、弦袋つけたる太刀脇はさんで、殿上の小庭に畏てぞ候ける。,"Clad in a light blue hunting robe over a yellow-patterned haridare (cuirass), with a sword sheathed in a quiver at his side, he stood respectfully in the palace's small courtyard."
2,12,貫首以下あやしみをなし、「うつぼ柱よりうち、鈴の綱のへんに布衣の者の候ふはなにものぞ。狼藉なり。罷出よ。」と、六位をもていはせければ、家貞申すは「相傳の主、備前守殿今夜闇討にせられ給べき由承候あひだ、其ならむ様を見むと<sentence> て、かくて候。えこそ罷出まじけれ。」とて畏て候ければ、是等をよしなしとやおもはれけん、其夜の闇討なかりけり。,"From executioners downwards, they shouted: 'Having a commoner near the pillar and bell rope is disgraceful!

2,13,て、かくて候。,Thus it was arranged.
2,14,えこそ罷出まじけれ。,"Indeed, one must not leave."

2,18,其うへ忠盛目のすがまれたりければ、加様にはやされけり。,"Had Tadamori seen them, he surely would have been astonished."
2,19,いかにすべき樣もなくして、御遊もいまだをはらざるに、竊に罷出らるとて、よこたへさされたりける刀をば紫宸殿の御後にして、かたへの殿上人のみられける所にて、主殿司をめしてあづけ置てぞ出られける。,"Without knowing what to do, while the Emperor continued his entertainment, he secretly left, placed his sword near the Purple Palace's rear where courtiers could see it, and reported to the Chamberlain Office."
2,20,家貞待うけたてまつて、「さていかゞ候つる。」と申すれば、かくともいはまほしう思はれけれども、いひつるものならば、殿上までもやがてきりのぼらんずる者にてある間、「別の事もなし。」とぞ答られける。,"Kazumasa waited and asked: 'What will you do next?' Though he thought it best to depart, considering that assassins might soon arrive, he replied: 'There is nothing further to discuss.'"
2,21,五節には、「白薄様、こぜむじの紙、卷上の筆、鞆繪ゑがいたる筆の軸」なんどさま％＼面白き事をのみこそうたひまはるるに、中比太宰権帥季仲卿といふ人ありけり。,"At the Gosechi festival, amusing items like 'white thin cloth, papers for rolling, brushes with painted handles' were displayed. Among them was Saemon Gon-kyō Sanae no Kuniyuki."

2,24,又花山院前太政大臣忠雅公、いまだ十歳と申し時、父中納言忠宗卿におくれたてまつて孤にておはしけるを、故中御門藤中納言家成卿いまだ播磨守たりし時、聟に執て、声花にもてなされければ、それも五節に「播磨米はとくさか、むくの葉か、人のきらをみがくは。」とぞはやされける。,"Additionally, when former Prime Minister Tadamasa of the Hanaoka-tenno line was ten years old and being raised as an orphan by his father Naidaijin Tadamune. When Kōshikibu no Naishi's son Kazunori (then Harima Province Governor) arranged a marriage with 'a voice like flowers,' at the Gosechi festival they chanted: 'Harima rice is fragrant, its leaves sweet, polishing people's spirits!'"

2,26,末代いかゞあらんずらむ、おぼつかなしとぞ人申ける。,"People say the end times will surely come, though it is uncertain."
2,27,案のごとく五節はてにしかば、殿上人一同に申されけるは、「夫雄劍を帶して公宴に列し、兵仗を給て、宮中を出入するはみな格式の禮をまもる綸命よしある先規なり。しかるを忠盛朝臣或は相傳の郎従と號して布衣の兵を殿上の小庭にめしおき、或は腰の刀を横へさいて節繪の座につらなる。兩條希代いまだきかざる狼藉なり。事既に重疊せり。罪科尤ものがれがたし。早く御札をけづて闕官停任せらるべき由」おの／＼訴へ申されければ、上皇大に驚きおぼしめし、忠盛をめして御尋あり。,"As it was, the courtiers collectively reported: 'Carrying swords to banquets and being granted weapons for palace access are ancient traditions. However, Lord Tadamori has allowed retainers dressed as commoners to stand in the courtyard or place their swords horizontally at festival seats—unprecedented chaos! Punishment is necessary.' The Retired Emperor was greatly alarmed and summoned Tadamori."
2,28,陳じ申せるは、「まづ郎従小庭に祗候の由、全く覺悟つかまつらず。但し、近日人々あひたくまるゝ旨子細ある歟の間、年來の家人、事をつたへきくかによて其恥をたすけむがために、忠盛にしられずして竊に參候の條力及ざる次第なり。若し猶其咎あるべくば、彼身をめし進ずべき歟。次に刀の事、主殿司に預け置をはぬ。是をめし出され刀の實否について咎の左右あるべき歟。」と申。,"Tadamori explained: 'First, allowing retainers to serve in the courtyard was not part of my instructions. However, due to recent disturbances among people, I let trusted retainers handle matters to avoid shame without informing you. If there's blame, punish them instead. Regarding the sword left with the Chamberlain, its authenticity should be verified.'"
2,29,しかるべしとて、其刀をめし出して叡覽ければ、上皇は鞘卷のくろくぬりたりけるが、中は木刀に銀薄をぞおしたりける。,"Thus ordered, the sword was presented. The Retired Emperor saw the scabbard was darkened but inside contained a wooden sword with silver foil."
2,30,「当座の恥辱をのがれん爲に刀を帶する由あらはすといへども、後日の訴訟を存知して、木刀を帯しける用意のほどこそ神妙なれ。弓箭に携らむ者のはかりごとは尤かうこそあらまほしけれ。兼ては又郎従小庭に祗候の條且は武士の郎等のならひなり。忠盛が咎にあらず。」とて却て叡,"Tadamori explained: 'I carried a sword to avoid immediate shame, but knowing future disputes, I prepared a wooden one. Those carrying bows should be especially careful. Letting retainers serve in the courtyard is customary for warriors. Tadamori is blameless.'"
2,31,感にあづかしうへは敢て罪科の沙汰もなかりけり。,"Moved by his explanation, the Retired Emperor did not pursue punishment."
3,0,其子どもは諸衞の佐になり、昇殿せしに殿上のまじはりを人きらふに及ばず。,"His son became the assistant of Shomei, and when he was granted entry to the palace, his mastery of courtly etiquette surpassed all others."
3,1,忠盛、備前国より都へのぼりたりけるに、鳥羽院「明石浦はいかに。」と御尋ありければ、あり明の月もあかしのうら風に、浪ばかりこそよると見えしか。,"When Tadashige ascended from Bizen Province to the capital, upon Emperor Toba's inquiry, 'How is Akashi Bay?', he replied that even the bright moon seemed to shine through the wind, and only the waves roared."
3,2,と申したりければ、御感ありけり。,"Upon hearing this, His Majesty was deeply moved."
3,3,この歌は金葉集にぞ入られける。,This poem is indeed found in the Kin'yō Wakashū (Imperial Anthology).
3,4,忠盛又仙洞に最愛の女房をもてかよはれけるが、ある時、其女房のつぼねに、つまに月出したる扇をわすれて出されたりければ、かたへの女房たち「是はいづくよりの月影ぞや。出どころおぼつかなし。」などわらひあはれければ、彼女房、雲井よりたゞもりきたる月なれば、おぼろげにてはいはじとぞ思ふ。,"Tadashige also frequented a beloved concubine at the retired emperor's residence. One day, when she accidentally left her crescent-moon-shaped fan outside, other women joked, 'Is this not moonlight from nowhere? It’s hard to trace its origin.' Realizing it symbolized the ephemeral nature of the moon (like a reflection in the pond), she felt a bittersweet sorrow."
3,5,とよみたりければ、いとゞあさからずぞおもはれける。,"When recited, it evokes profound melancholy."
3,6,薩摩守忠度の母、是なり。,"This woman was the mother of Tadatsune, Lord of Satsuma Province."
3,7,にるを友とかやの風情に忠盛もすいたりければ、かの女房も優なりけり。,"Though Tadashige shared a refined taste with the retired emperor, this woman was exceptionally virtuous."
3,8,かくて忠盛刑部卿になて、仁平三年正月十五日歳五十八にてうせにき。,"Thus, Tadashige served as Minister of Justice until his death on the fifteenth day of the first month of 1157 at age fifty-eight."
3,9,清盛嫡男たるによてその迹をつぐ。,"As Tairano Kiyomori's heir, his son inherited his legacy."
3,10,保元々年七月に宇治の左府代をみだり給し時、安藝守とて御方にて勳功ありしかば、播磨守にうつて同三年太宰大貳になる。,"In July of the Kyūnengō Era (1147), during an incident at the Uji Left Palace, as Lord of Aki Province he distinguished himself in service to His Majesty. Later promoted to Governor of Harima Province and in 1150 became Grand Controller of Dazaifu."
3,11,次に平治元年十二月、信頼卿が謀反の時、御方にて賊徒を,"In December of the Heiji Era (1159), during Prince Narihira's rebellion, he led His Majesty's forces against the rebels."
3,12,うちたひらげ、勳功一にあらず、恩賞是おもかるべしとて、次の年正三位に敍せられ、うちつゞき、宰相、衛府督、檢非違使別当、中納言、大納言に歴あがて、剰へ丞相の位にいたり、左右を歴ずして内大臣より太政大臣従一位にあがる。,"His unparalleled achievements earned him promotion to Junior Third Rank in 1160. He ascended through successive offices: Minister of State, Captain of the Guards, Director of Legal Affairs, Middle Counselor, Senior Counselor, and eventually Chancellor. After serving both Left and Right Minister roles, he attained Grand Councilor status and Junior First Rank."
3,13,大將にあらね共、兵仗をたまはて隨身をめし具す。,"Even as Supreme Commander, he carried his weapons personally, never neglecting martial readiness."
3,14,牛車輦車の宣旨を蒙て、のりながら宮中を出入す。,"Granted imperial permission to use both ox-drawn and palanquin carriages, he freely traversed the palace grounds."
3,15,偏に執政の臣のごとし。,This was befitting a Regent-like statesman.
3,16,「太政大臣は一人に師範として四海に儀刑せり。國を治め、道を論じ、陰陽をやはらげをさむ。其人にあらずば即ち闕けよ。」といへり。,"They said: 'The Minister of State serves as a paragon for all, governing realms, upholding principles, and harmonizing yin and yang. Without such a man, the office itself becomes vacant.'"
3,17,されば則闕の官とも名付たり。,Hence it was called the 'Office of the Vacant' when unoccupied.
3,18,其人ならではけがすべき官ならねども、一天四海を掌の内ににぎられしうへは子細に及ばず。,"Though meant for a singular individual, the extent of governing the realm defies detailed explanation."
3,19,平家かやうに繁昌せられけるも熊野權現の御利生とぞきこえし。,The Taira's prosperity was said to be a manifestation of Kumano Gongen's grace.
3,20,其故は、古へ清盛公、いまだ安藝守たりし時、伊勢の海より船にて熊野へまゐられけるに、大きなる鱸の船にをどり入たりけるを、先達申けるは、「是は權現の御利生なり。いそぎまゐるべし。」と申ければ、清盛のたまひけるは、「昔、周の武王の船にこそ白魚は躍入したりけるなれ。是吉事なり。」とて、さばかり十戒をたもちて、精進潔齋の道なれども、調味して家の子、侍ともにくはせられけり。,"This stemmed from an earlier incident: When Kiyomori, then Lord of Aki Province, sailed to Kumano via the Ise Sea, a large red snapper leaped into his boat. The crew declared it 'a divine omen.' Recalling King Wu of Zhou's white fish omen, he maintained vegetarian vows but had the fish prepared for family and retainers."
3,21,其故にや吉事のみうちつゞいて太政大臣まできはめ給へり。,Thus his auspicious deeds culminated in appointment as Minister of State.
3,22,子孫の官途も龍の雲に上るよりは猶すみやかなり。,His descendants rose higher than the clouds of a dragon's ascent.
3,23,九代の先蹤をこえ給ふこそ目出けれ。,They surpassed even their nine ancestral generations' achievements—truly remarkable!
4,0,角て清盛公、仁安三年十一月十一日歳五十一にて病にをかされ、存命の為に忽に出家入道す。,"The lord Kiyomori, on the eleventh day of the eleventh month in the third year of仁安 (1168), at fifty-one years old, fell gravely ill and abruptly became a monk to preserve his life."
4,1,法名は淨海とこそなのられけれ。,His posthumous Buddhist name was given as Jōkai.
4,2,其しるしにや、宿病たちどころにいえて、天命を全す。,This was no mere sign of his chronic illness; it was the fulfillment of divine decree.
4,3,人のしたがひつく事吹風の草木をなびかすがごとし。,"People followed like wind-tossed grass and trees, swayed by collective动向."
4,4,世のあまねく仰げる事ふる雨の國土をうるほすに同じ。,"The world universally revered him, akin to how aged rain nourishes the earth."
4,5,六波羅殿の御一家の君達といひてしかば、花族も英雄も面をむかへ肩をならぶる人なし。,"Even among the Heike clan’s noble lords, no flower-like magnates or heroic figures dared face one another."
4,6,されば入道相國のこしうと、平大納言時忠卿ののたまひけるは「此一門にあらざらむ人は皆人非人なるべし。」とぞのたまひける。,Thus spoke the Retired Regent and Lord Chamberlain Tokitada Shigetada: 'Those outside this lineage are not truly human.'
4,7,かゝりしかば、いかなる人も相構へて其ゆかりにむすぼほれんとぞしける。,"Yet all sought to align themselves with their connections, regardless of consequence."
4,8,衣文のかきやう烏帽子のため様よりはじめて何事も六波羅樣といひてければ、一天四海の人皆是をまなぶ。,"From the style of their robes and caps, all affairs came to be called 'Heike-style,' drawing attention across the realm."
4,9,又いかなる賢王聖主の御政も攝政関白の御成敗も世にあまされたるいたづら者などの、人のきかぬ處にてなにとなうそしり傾け申事は常の習なれども、此禪門世ざかりの程は聊いるかせにも申者なし。,"Though even wise kings’ rule and regents’ decrees are criticized in secrecy, no one dared speak of the Heike’s methods—even as they transcended常规."
4,10,其故は入道相國のはかりごとに十四五六の童部を三百人そろへて、髮をかぶろにきりまはし、あかき直垂をきせて、めしつかはれけるが、京中にみち／＼て、往反しけり。,"The Retired Regent assembled three hundred young attendants (ages fourteen to sixteen), shaved their heads, dressed them in crimson straight-sleeved robes, and paraded them through Kyoto’s streets."
4,11,自ら平家の事あしざまに申者あれば、一人きゝ出さぬほどこそありけれ、餘黨に觸廻して、其家に亂入し資材雜具を追捕し、其奴を搦とて、六波羅へゐてまゐる。,"When a spy exposed Heike affairs, they would raid the informant’s home at night, seize supplies and servants, and drag them to Rokuhara."
4,12,されば目に見、心に知るといへども、詞にあらはれて申者なし。,"Though witnessed by eyes and understood by hearts, none dared commit it to speech."
4,13,六波羅殿の禿と云ひてしかば、道をすぐる馬車もよぎてぞ、通りける。,"Known as the 'Bald Ones of Rokuhara,' carriages would swerve to avoid them on roads."
4,14,禁門を出入すといへども姓名を尋らるゝに及ばず、京師の長吏これが為に目を側むとみえたり。,"They entered and exited the Imperial Gates unchecked, their names unasked, while Kyoto’s officials averted their gaze in awe."
5,0,吾身の榮花を極るのみならず、一門共に繁昌して、嫡子重盛、内大臣の左大將、次男宗盛、中納言の右大將、三男知盛、三位中將、嫡孫維盛、四位少將、すべて一門の公卿十六人、殿上人三十餘人、諸国の受領、衞府、諸司、都合六十餘人なり。,"Not only did I reach the peak of glory, but my entire clan flourished: eldest son Shigemori became Left Major Captain under Minister of the Interior; second son Munemori attained Right Major Captainship as Middle Counselor; third son Tomomori held Third Rank Lieutenant position; grandson Yoshimori was appointed Fourth Rank Junior General. In total, sixteen court nobles from our lineage, over thirty attendants at court, regional governors across provinces, officials in palace guards and ministries - altogether more than sixty positions were held by my family."
5,1,世にはまた人なくぞ見えられける。,In this world there was no one comparable to him.
5,2,昔奈良の御門の御時、神龜五年、朝家に中衞の大將をはじめおかれ、大同四年に中衞を近衞と改られしよりこのかた、兄弟左右に相並事僅に三四箇度なり。,"During the time of Nara's imperial gates, in 729 (Kinmu 5), the first Major Captain of Middle Palace Guards was established. Since their renaming to Imperial Guards in 809 (Daido 4), brothers holding concurrent left-right positions occurred only three or four times."
5,3,文徳天皇の御時は左に良房右大臣左大將、右に良相、大納言の右大將、是は閑院の左大臣冬嗣の御子なり。,"During Emperor Montoku's reign: on the left, Yoshifumi Saionji served as Right Minister and Left Major Captain; on the right, Yoshimitsu held Middle Counselor position with Right Major Captainship - both being sons of Michitaka, Left Minister of闲院 Palace."
5,4,朱雀院の御宇には左に実頼、小野宮殿、右に師輔、九條殿、貞信公の御子なり。,"During Emperor Suzaku's reign: on the left, Sanekuni (of Ono Palace) served; on the right, Michitaka (of Kujō Palace) - both sons of Sadaijin Sanezumi."

5,7,是皆攝,All these were unprecedented
5,8,禄の臣の御子息、凡人にとりては其例なし。,"For the sons of Roku-no-kami nobles, such occurrences had no precedent among ordinary people."
5,9,殿上の交をだにきらはれし人の子孫にて禁色雜袍をゆり、綾羅錦繍を身にまとひ、大臣大將になて、兄弟、左右に相並事、末代とはいひながら不思議なりし事どもなり。,"Even descendants of those shunned at court, wearing forbidden colored surcoats and silk brocades, holding Minister-Major Captain positions with brothers serving concurrently left-right - though this seems miraculous for later generations."
5,10,其外御娘八人おはしき。,"Additionally, eight princesses graced the court."
5,11,皆とり／＼に幸給へり。,All received imperial favors and stipends.
5,12,一人は櫻町の中納言重教卿の北の方にておはすべかりしが、八歳の時約束ばかりにて平治の亂以後ひきちがへられ、花山院の左大臣殿の御臺盤所にならせ給て君達あまたましましけり。,"One was destined to be Northern Consort of Middle Counselor Shigeyuki Sakura-machi, but at age eight during the Heiji Disturbance, she was taken from her betrothed and raised as the concubine of Hana-no-Miya (left minister) in the Imperial Palace's music pavilion."
5,13,抑この重教卿の櫻町の中納言と申ける事はすぐれて心數奇給へる人にて、つねは吉野山をこひ、町に櫻をうゑならべ、其内に屋を立て、すみたまひしかば、来る年の春ごとに、みる人櫻町とぞ申ける。,"Moreover, this Shigeyuki (Middle Counselor of Sakura-machi) was known for his ingenious mind. He often resided in Yoshino Mountain and planted cherry blossoms throughout the city. Wherever he settled, people would name that area 'Sakura Town' expecting spring blooms."
5,14,櫻はさいて七箇日にちるを、名殘を惜み天照御神に祈申されければ、三七日迄名残ありけり。,"Though cherry blossoms typically last seven days, through prayers to Amaterasu, they would remain for twenty-one days."
5,15,君も賢王にてましませば神も神徳を輝かし、花も心ありければ、二十日の齡をたもちけり。,"If a wise ruler governed, the gods would shine their virtue and flowers would gain soul - lasting twenty days."

5,32,歌堂舞閣の基、魚龍爵馬の翫物、恐らくは帝闕も仙洞も是にはすぎじとぞ見えし。,"Palace music halls and dance pavilions, with dragon-fish and horse-jewel decorations - even celestial palaces could not surpass this splendor."
6,0,入道相國、一天四海をたなごゝろのうちににぎりたまひし間、世のそしりをもはばからず、人の嘲りをもかへり見ず、不思議の事をのみし給へり。,"During the time when Lord Nīdō (Kiyomori) casually gathered the four seas under his authority, he neither avoided societal scorn nor turned away from people's mockery, devoting himself solely to mysterious matters."
6,1,たとへば其比都に聞えたる白拍子の上手、祇王祇女とて兄弟あり、とぢといふ白拍子が娘なり。,"For example, in the capital there was a renowned shirabyoshi (white drummer) named Jijō Jijū, siblings who were mother and daughter. Their daughter Tōji was also an expert white drummer."
6,2,姊の祇王を入道相國最愛せられければ、是によて妹の祇女をも世の人もてなす事なのめならず。,"Since the elder sister Jijō was most beloved by Lord Nīdō, it naturally followed that his younger sister Jijū would not be neglected by worldly people."
6,3,母とぢにもよき屋つくてとらせ、毎月百石百貫をおくられければ、家内富貴してたのしい事なのめならず。,"Their mother was provided with a fine house, given 100 koku and 100 man of rice monthly. This made their household prosperous and enjoyable beyond measure."
6,4,抑我朝に白拍子のはじまりける事は、昔鳥羽院の御宇に島の千歳和歌の前とてこれら二人がまひいだしたりけるなり。,"Indeed, the origin of white drummers in our land dates back to the reign of Emperor Toba, when these two women first performed before His Majesty at the Island of Thousand Years' Poetry Contest."
6,5,始めは水干に立烏帽子、白鞘卷をさいて、舞ひければ、男舞とぞ申ける。,"Originally, they wore montsuki (formal kimono) with standing hachimaki (headgear), white-sheathed sword sashes, and were called male dancers when performing."
6,6,然るを中比より烏帽子、刀をのけられ、水干ばかりをもちゐたり、さてこそ白拍子とは名付けれ。,"However, from the middle period onward they removed their hachimaki and swords, wearing only montsuki. Thus were truly named white drummers."
6,7,京中の白拍子ども祇王が幸の目出度きやうをきいてうらやむ者もあり、そねむ者もありけり。,"In the capital, many white drummers envied Jijō's good fortune - some admired her, others begrudged her happiness."
6,8,羡む者共は「あなめでたの祇王御前が幸や。おなじあそび女とならば、誰もみなあの樣でこそありたけれ。いかさま是は祇といふ文字を名についてかくはめでたきやらん。,"The envious ones said: 'Alas, how fortunate Lady Jijō! If all playgirls could become like her, surely everyone would. This 'Ji' character in their names must be some divine curse!'"
6,9,そねむ者どもは「なん條名により、文字にはよるべき。幸はたゞ前世の生れつきにてこそあんなれ。」とてつかぬ者もおほかりけり。,"The begrudging ones claimed: 'Fortune depends not on names, but on karmic predisposition from past lives.' Many remained unconvinced."
7,0,昔より今に至るまで、源平兩氏朝家に召しつかはれて、王化に隨はず、自朝權を輕んずる者には、互に誡を加しかば、代の亂れもなかりしに、保元に爲義きられ、平治に義朝誅せられて後は、末々の源氏ども、或は流され、或は失はれ、今は平家の一類のみ繁昌して、頭をさし出す者なし。,"From ancient times to the present, since both the Minamoto and Taira clans were summoned by the court, disregarding royal authority and wielding their own power, mutual strife has been inevitable. Although there was no disorder in earlier generations, after Yoshitomo of the Heike was executed in the Hōgen Disturbance and Yoshikuni of the Genji was annihilated in the Heiji Rebellion, the descendants of the Minamoto were either exiled or lost, while only one branch of the Taira clan thrives today with none daring to challenge their dominance."
7,1,如何ならん末の代までも、何事かあらむとぞ見えし。,How shall it fare even in later generations? It seems inevitable that some great event will come to pass.
7,2,されども鳥羽院、御晏駕の後は、兵革打ち續き、死罪、流刑、闕官、停任、常を行はれて、海内も靜かならず。,"However, after the passing of Emperor Toba, continuous warfare ensued. Capital punishment, exile, dismissals, suspensions of office—all became common occurrences—and the nation remained unsettled."
7,3,世間も末落居せず。,The world also declined without respite.
7,4,就中に永暦應保の比よりして、院の近習者をば、内より御誡あり、内の近習者をば、院より誡めらるゝ間、上下おそれをのゝいて、安い心もなし。,"Especially during the eras of Eiryaku and Ōhō, courtiers close to the retired emperor were punished by the palace, while those near the inner court were reprimanded by the retired emperor. In this atmosphere of mutual fear between upper and lower ranks, no one could rest easy."
7,5,只深淵にのぞんで薄氷をふむに同じ、主上上皇、父子の御間には何事の御隔かあるべきなれども、思の外の事どもありけり。,"Like walking on thin ice over an abyss, although there should be no enmity between the sovereign and his retired father, unexpected discord arose."
7,6,是も世澆季に及んで、人梟惡を先とする故なり。,"This was because, in a degenerate age, men put evil before virtue."
7,7,主上院の仰を常に申かへさせおはしましける中にも、人耳目を驚し、世以て大きに傾け申すことありけり。,"Even as the sovereign sought to obey his father's wishes, rumors that shook the nation spread among people."
7,8,故近衞院の后、太皇太后宮と申しは大炊御門右大臣公能公の御娘なり。,"Thus, after the retirement of Emperor Kenshō, the new Empress Dowager was the daughter of Kuromon-no-Udaijin Konomi, Lord of the Great Kitchen Gate."
7,9,先帝に後れ奉らせ給ひて後は、九重の外、近衞川原の御所にぞ移り住ませ給ひける。,"After serving as Empress to the late emperor, she was moved from the inner palace to the Kenrei Riverbank Residence beyond the Ninefold Gate."
7,10,前の后の宮にて、幽なる御在樣にて渡らせ給ひしが、永歴のころほひは、御年二十二三にもやならせたまひけん、御盛りも少し過させおはしますほどなり。,"Though she had been kept in seclusion as a former empress, around the Eiryaku era she was permitted to reside at her own quarters. By then she had reached about 22-23 years of age, having slightly passed her prime."
7,11,されども、天下第一の美人の聞えまし／＼ければ、主上色にのみ染める御心にて、竊に高力士に詔して、外宮に引き求めしむるに及んで、この大宮へ御艶書あり。,"However, upon hearing that she was the foremost beauty in the land, the sovereign, consumed by passion, secretly summoned her through a trusted eunuch named Takanosuke to the outer palace. This caused great consternation among courtiers."
7,12,大宮敢て聞食しもいれず。,The Empress Dowager stubbornly refused to acknowledge this.
7,13,されば、ひたすらはやほに現はれて、后御入内あるべきよし、右大臣家に宣旨を下さる。,"Thus, urgent imperial decrees were issued to the Udaijin's household demanding that the Empress Dowager enter the palace."
7,14,此事天下に於て、異なる勝事なれば、公卿僉議あり、各意見をいふ。,"This unprecedented event caused great discussion among the court nobles, who expressed various opinions."
7,15,「先づ異朝の先蹤をとぶらふに、震旦の則天皇后は、唐の太宗の后、高宗皇帝の繼母なり。太宗崩御の後、高宗の后に立ち給へることあり。それは異朝の先規たる上、別段の事なり。然れども我朝には、神武天皇より以降、人皇七十餘代に及まで、いまだ二代の后に立たせ給へる例を聞かず。」と、諸卿一同に申されけり。,"Some argued: 'Following precedents from other nations, Empress Wu of China served as both Emperor Taizong's consort and later Empress Dowager for Emperor Gaozong. However in our land since Emperor Jimmu, through over seventy generations of human emperors, there has never been a case where two successive empresses were appointed.'"
7,16,上皇も然るべからざるよし、こしらへ申させ給へば、主上仰なりけるは、「天子に父母なし、我十善の戒功によて、萬乘の寶,"The retired emperor, understanding this was unavoidable, relayed the sovereign's words: 'The Son of Heaven has no parents. Through my observance of the Ten Virtuous Precepts and the merits of preserving imperial authority..."
7,17,位をたもつ、是程のこと、などか叡慮に任せざるべき。,...I cannot leave such weighty matters to my deliberation alone.'
7,18,」とて、やがて御入内の日、宣下せられける上は、力及ばせ給はず。,"Thus, despite these protests, the day of the Empress Dowager's formal entry was decreed without further delay."
7,19,大宮かくと聞しめされけるより、御涙に沈ませおはします。,"Upon hearing this, the Empress Dowager wept bitterly."
7,20,先帝に後させ參らせにし久壽の秋のはじめ、同じ野原の露と消え、家をも出、世をも遁れたりせば、かゝる憂き耳をば聞かざらましとぞ、御歎ありける。,"She lamented: 'When I served the late emperor during my youth, like morning dew on a meadow, I vanished from both family and world. Had I known this grief would come again!'"
7,21,父の大臣、こしらへ申させ給ひけるは、「世に從はざるを以て、狂人とすと見えたり。既に詔命を下さる。仔細を申すにところなし。只速に參らせ給ふべきなり。もし皇子御誕生ありて、君も國母といはれ、愚老も外祖と仰がるべき瑞相にてもや候ふらむ。是偏に愚老をたすけさせおはします御孝行の御至なるべし。」と、申させ給へども、御返事もなかりけり。,"The father, Lord Udaijin, urged: 'Since the world rejects this course, they call us madmen. With imperial decrees already issued, there is no room for discussion. You must hasten to comply. Should a prince be born, you would become Queen Mother and I, your grandfather—a most auspicious occasion to demonstrate filial piety.' But his words went unheeded."
7,22,大宮その比、なにとなき御手習の次に、うきふしにしづみもやらで河竹の、世にためしなき名をやながさん。,"In her youth, the Empress Dowager had been known as 'Ukifuri' (Floating Mist) during handiwork lessons, earning an unprecedented reputation."
7,23,世にはいかにして漏れけるやらん、哀にやさしきためしにぞ人々申しあへりける。,"How this secret came to light remains unknown, though it moved people deeply."
7,24,既に御入内の日になりしかば、父の大臣供奉の上達部、出車の儀式など、心ことにだしたて參らせ給ひけり。,"As the day of entry approached, Lord Udaijin meticulously prepared all protocols and carriages."
7,25,大宮ものうき御出立なれば、とみにもたてまつらず。,"Yet the Empress Dowager, pale as death, could not be roused."
7,26,遙に夜も深け、小夜も半になて後、御車に抜け乘せられ給ひけり。,Not until midnight did she finally enter the imperial carriage.
7,27,御入内の後は、麗景殿にぞまし／＼ける。,"After her entry, she resided in the Rikkyō Palace."
7,28,ひたすら、朝政をすゝめ申させ給ふ御在樣なり。,She devoted herself to state affairs with diligence.
7,29,彼紫宸殿の皇居には、賢聖の障子を立てられたり。,"In the imperial palace's Purple Hall, screens depicting sages were installed."
7,30,伊尹、第伍倫、虞世南、太公望、,"Yi Yin, Wulun, Yu Shinan, and Taigong Wang..."
7,31,ろく里先生、李勣、司馬、手長、足長、馬形の障子、鬼の間、李將軍が姿をさながら寫せる障子もあり。,"The Six Wise Men of the Mountain, Li Ji, Sima, Hand-Long and Foot-Long (mythical figures), horse-shaped screens, demon-hall panels, and screens vividly depicting General Li's likeness..."
7,32,尾張守小野道風が、七囘賢聖の障子と書,Governor Ono no Michikaze painted the Seven Sages screens...
7,33,けるも、理とぞ見えし。,...all executed with consummate artistry.
7,34,かの清凉殿の畫圖の御障子には、昔金岡が書きたりし遠山の在明の月もありとかや。,"Among the screens in the清凉殿 (Cool Hall), was one depicting distant mountains and a moon by Kinoka, a painter of yore..."
7,35,故院の未幼主にてましましけるそのかみ、何となき御手まさぐりの次に、かきくもらかさせ給ひしが、ありしながらに少しもたがはぬを御覽じて、先帝の昔もや御戀しくおぼし召されけん。,"This divine artwork, preserved for generations since the retired emperor's childhood, moved him to recall his late father's fondness for it."
7,36,思ひきや憂き身ながらにめぐり來て、おなじ雲井の月を見むとは。,"Alas, how strange that this man of grief now beheld the same moon over Cloud Well..."
7,37,その間の御なからへ、いひしらず哀にやさしきためしにぞ人々申しあへりける。,These thoughts moved all present to silent sorrow.
7,38,さる程に、永萬元年の春の比より、主上御不豫の御事と聞えさせ給ひしが、夏の初になりしかば、事の外に重らせ給ふ。,"Then, in the spring of Eiman Year 1, rumors spread of the sovereign's illness. By early summer, his condition worsened."
7,39,是によて、大藏の大輔伊吉兼盛が娘の腹に、今上の一の宮の二歳にならせ給ふがまし／＼けるを、太子にたてまゐらせ給ふべしと聞えし程に、同六月二十五日、俄に親王の宣旨下されて、やがてその夜受禪ありしかば、天下何となうあわてたるさま也。,"This led to reports that the Minister of the Treasury's daughter, who carried the crown prince (now two years old), would be named heir apparent. On June 25th, suddenly a royal edict was issued appointing Prince as successor, with his enthronement occurring that very night—causing nationwide consternation."
7,40,その時の有職の人々申しあはれけるは、本朝に、童帝の例を尋ぬれば、清和天皇九歳にして、文徳天皇の御禪を受けさせ給ふ。,"Scholars explained: 'In our nation, the precedent for child emperors is Emperor Seiwa at nine years old, who received abdication from his father Emperor Montoku..."
7,41,それは彼周公旦の成王に代り、南面にして、一日萬機の政を治め給ひしに准へて、外祖忠仁公、幼主を扶持し給へり。,"...modeled after the Duke of Zhou assisting young King Cheng of Zhou, with Grand Counselor Tadahito serving as regent."
7,42,是ぞ攝政のはじめなる。,This established the system of regency.
7,43,鳥羽院五歳、近衞院三歳にて踐祚あり。,"Later, Emperor Toba ascended at five and Kenreimon-in at three..."

7,45,先例なし。,Without historical parallel.
7,46,物さわがしともおろかなり。,A most unsettling development.

8,11,然るを山門の大衆、いかがおもひけん、先例を背て、東大寺の次ぎ、興福寺のうへに、延暦寺の額を打つ間、南都の大衆、とやせましかやうせましと僉議するところに、興福寺の西金堂の衆、観音房、勢至房とて聞えたる大惡僧二人ありけり。,"However, the mountain temple assembly (Enryaku-ji), disregarding precedent, placed Enryaku-ji's nameplate after Todai-ji but before Kofuku-ji. The southern capital monks fiercely opposed this, declaring 'How can we endure this?' At that moment, two wicked monks from Kofuku-ji's West Golden Hall—the Chamberlain of Kannon and the Chamberlain of Jizo—learned of these events."
8,12,観音房は黒絲威の腹卷に、白柄の長刀くきみじかに取り、勢至房は、萠黄威の腹卷に、黒漆の大太刀もて、二人つと走出で、延暦寺の額をきて落し、散々に打わり、「うれしや水、なるは瀧の水、日はてるとも、絶えずとうたへ。」とはやしつゝ、南都の衆徒の中へぞ入りにける。,"The Kannon Chamberlain, clad in black-silk armor and wielding a long sword with a white hilt, and the Jizo Chamberlain, armored in green silk and brandishing a large black-lacquered sword, rushed forth. They shattered Enryaku-ji's nameplate, scattering it to pieces while shouting, 'How joyous! It is water from a waterfall—though the sun sets, its song never ceases!' Then they plunged into the midst of the southern capital's monks."
9,0,山門の大衆、狼藉をいたさば、手向へすべき処に、心深うねらふ方もやありけん。,"The great multitude of the temple gate, having caused chaos, even in matters where they should act, their hearts deeply agitated."
9,1,一詞も出さず。,Not a single word was spoken.
9,2,御門かくれさせ給ひては、心なき草木までも、愁へたる色にてこそあるべきに、この,"When the imperial gate is concealed, even heartless plants and trees should show a sorrowful hue—this"
9,3,騒動のあさましさに、高きも賤きも、肝魂を失て四方へ皆退散す。,The severity of the tumult caused both high and low-ranking individuals to lose their spirit and scatter in all directions.
9,4,同二十九日の午の刻ばかり、山門の大衆おびたゞしう下洛すと聞えしかば、武士、,"Around the noon hour of the same twenty-ninth day, when it was heard that the great multitude of the temple gate had descended to Kyoto, warriors"
9,5,檢非違使、西坂本に馳向て、防ぎけれども、事ともせずおしやぶて亂入す。,"and the Bureau of Police rushed to Nishiyama. Though they attempted to block, their efforts proved futile as they were pushed back and entered in disorder."
9,6,何者の申出したりけるやらむ、一院、山門の大衆に仰せて、平家を追討せらるべしと聞えし程に、軍兵内裏に参じて、四方の陣頭を警固す。,"As to who proposed this, it was heard that the sovereign ordered the great multitude of the temple gate to attack the Heike clan.

9,11,山門の大衆、六波羅へは寄せずして、すずろなる清水寺におしよせて、佛閣僧房一宇も殘さず燒はらふ。,"The great multitude of the temple gate did not approach Rokuhara but instead went to the quiet Seiryo-ji, burning every building of the temple and monk's quarters without exception."

9,19,重盛卿、御送よりかへられたりければ、父の大納言の給ひけるは、「一院の御幸こそ大きに恐れおぼゆれ。かねても思しめしより、仰せらるゝ旨のあればこそかうは聞ゆらめ、それにも打解給ふまじ。」とのたまへば、重盛卿申されけるは、「此事ゆめ／＼御けしきにも、御詞にも出させ給ふべからず、人に心附けがほに、,"When Lord Shigemori returned after escorting the sovereign, his father the Major Counselor said to him, 'I greatly fear for the safety of the sovereign's journey. Even though I have long worried about this, if there is an order, you must not speak openly or reveal it.' To which Lord Shigemori replied, 'This matter, even if it is something His Majesty deems necessary, should not be disclosed in words. It must be conveyed only through subtle means,"
9,20,中々惡しき御事なり。,for this is truly a grave matter.
9,21,それにつけても叡慮に背き給はで、人のために御なさけを施させましまさば、神明三寶加護あるべし。,"If we act contrary to divine wisdom and show mercy for the sake of others, then surely the gods and Buddhas will protect us."
9,22,さらんにとては、御身の恐れ候ふまじ。,There is no need to fear for Your Majesty's safety.
9,23,」とて、立たれければ「重盛卿は、ゆゝしく大様なるものかな。」とぞ父の卿ものたまひける。," Upon hearing this, his father said, 'Truly, Lord Shigemori is a man of great dignity.'"

9,25,境節御前近う候ひけるが、「天に口なし、人を以ていはせよと申す。平家以外に過分に候間、天の御計らひにや。」とぞ申しける。,"Approaching the sovereign, he said, 'Heaven has no mouth, so let humanity speak. If there is any excess beyond the Heike clan, it must be Heaven's will.'"
9,26,人々「この事よしなし。壁に耳あり、おそろしおそろし。」とぞ申あはれける。,"The people replied, 'This is indeed strange. Walls have ears—how terrifying.'"
10,0,さる程に、その年は諒闇なりければ、御禊大甞會も行はれず。,"Thus, as that year was in the period of mourning (Ryouan), the Oharai Taio no Kai ceremony could not be held."
10,1,同十二月二十四日、建春門院その比はいまだ東の御方と申しける御腹に、一院の宮まし／＼けるが、親王の宣旨下され給ふ。,"On the same month's 24th day, Imperial Princess Kenshunmon-in (建春門院), who was still with child by the Eastern Lord (東の御方) of the Emperor's line, bore a prince at one year old, upon which a decree from the Prince was issued."

10,10,いまだ御元服もなくして、太上天皇の尊號あり。,"Without having undergone the Genpuku coming-of-age ceremony, he held the revered title of Retired Emperor."
10,11,漢家本朝是やはじめならむ。,This was unprecedented in either Chinese or native traditions.
10,12,仁安三年三月二十日、新帝大極殿にして御即位あり。,"In Renan Year Three, on the twentieth day of the third month, the new emperor ascended the throne at Daigokuden Hall."
10,13,此君の位につかせ給ぬるは、いよ／＼平家の榮花とぞ見えし。,This sovereign's installation as ruler clearly demonstrated the glory of the Heike clan.
10,14,御母儀建春門院と申すは、平家の一門にてましますうへ、とりわき入道相國の北の方、二位殿の御妹なり。,"The Empress Dowager Kenshunmon-in, his mother, was a member of the Heike clan—specifically, the Northern Consort (北の方) of Retired Emperor Taira no Koremori (とりわき入道相國), and younger sister to Lady Niino (二位殿)."
10,15,又平大納言時忠卿と申も、女院の御兄なれば、内の御外戚なり。,"Furthermore, Lord Taira no Tokitada (平大納言時忠卿), as the elder brother of the Empress Dowager, was a member of her inner circle."

10,20,入道相國天下の大小事をのたまひあはせられければ、時の人平関白とぞ申しける。,"When Retired Emperor Taira no Kiyomori (入道相国) managed all great and small affairs of the realm, he was called 'Heike Sessho' (平関白), a title befitting his era."
11,0,さる程に、嘉応元年七月十六日、一院御出家あり。,"Thus, on July 16th of the first year of the Kyōan era (1169), Emperor Go-Shirakawa abdicated."
11,1,御出家の後も、萬機の政をきこめしされし間、院内わく方なし。,"Even after his abdication, during the period when he oversaw all matters of government, there was no disturbance within the palace."
11,2,院中にちかくめしつかはるゝ公卿殿上人、上下の北面に至るまで、官位俸禄、皆身に餘るばかりなり。,"From courtiers and nobles close to the palace down to the North Faces guards, all held ranks and stipends far beyond their station."

They muttered, 'Alas, if that person were to die, this land would surely become desolate; should he be lost, his office would remain vacant.' Even those of humble standing gathered to complain."
11,4,法皇も内々仰なりけるは、「昔より代々の朝敵を平ぐるもの多しといへども、いまだ加様の事なし。,"The Retired Emperor secretly declared, 'Throughout generations, many have quelled the court's enemies, yet never has such a thing occurred."

11,6,き。,.
11,7,清盛がかく心のまゝにふるまふこそ然るべからね。,Thus it was only fitting that Kiyomori acted according to his true heart.
11,8,これも世末になりて、王法の盡きぬる故なり。,This was due to the decay of the age and the exhaustion of royal law.
11,9,」と仰なりけれども、次でなければ御いましめもなし。,"He spoke thus, but no further imperial decree followed."
11,10,平家も又別して、朝家を恨み奉ることもなかりしほどに、世の亂れそめける根本は、去じ嘉応二年十月十六日に、小松殿の次男新三位中將資盛卿、その時はいまだ越前守とて十三になられけるが、雪ははだれに降りけり。,"Though the Heike bore no grudge against the court, the root of societal chaos lay in an event on October 16th of Kyōan's second year (1170): Prince Sumitomo, nephew of Kozukenosuke and newly appointed Middle General at age thirteen as governor of Echizen, rode out during a heavy snowfall."
11,11,枯野の景色まことに面白かりければ、わかき侍ども三十騎ばかりめし具して、蓮臺野や、紫野、右近馬場に打出でて、鷹どもあまたすゑさせ、鶉、雲雀をおたて／＼、終日にかり暮し、薄暮に及んで六波羅へこそ歸られけれ。,"Enchanted by the stark beauty of the winter field, thirty young attendants set out to hunt hawks at Renge野 and Muranba. They chased pheasants and sparrows all day, returning to Rokkaku only as dusk fell."
11,12,その時の御攝祿は、松殿にてましましけるが、中御門東洞院の御所より御參内ありけり。,"The Retired Emperor, residing at Matsu-den, had come to the East Dainagon's residence in Naka-no-Miya."
11,13,郁芳門より入御あるべきにて、東洞院を南へ、大炊御門を西へ御出なる。,"He intended to enter via the Yūshōmon Gate, proceeding south from East Dainagon and west through Daisui-mon."
11,14,資盛朝臣、大炊御門猪熊にて、殿下の御出に鼻突に參りあふ。,"At Hikozuma near Daisui-mon, Prince Sumitomo abruptly intercepted the procession."
11,15,御供の人々「何者ぞ、狼藉なり。御出なるに、乘物より下り候へ／＼。」と、云てけれども、餘に誇り勇み、世を世ともせざりける上、めし具したる侍ども、皆二十より内の若物共なり、禮義骨法辨へたる者一人もなし。,"The imperial retinue cried, 'Who dares cause disorder? Dismount as befits an escort!' But these young men—none over twenty, ignorant of decorum and devoid of reverence—ignored them."
11,16,殿下の御出ともいはず、一切下馬の禮義にも及ばず、驅け破て通らむとする間、暗さはくらし、つや／＼入道の孫とも知らず。,"They neither respected the prince's procession nor observed dismounting etiquette, charging recklessly through the dark. Not even recognizing Jōkai's grandson among them."
11,17,又少々は知たれども、空しらずして、資盛朝臣を始として、侍共皆馬より取て引落し、頗る耻辱に及びけり。,"Though some half-recognized him, they dragged Prince Sumitomo from his horse alongside the others, bringing great shame."
11,18,資盛朝臣、はふ／＼六波羅へおはして、祖父の相國禪門に、此由訴へ申されければ、入道大きに怒て、「縱ひ殿下なりとも、淨海があたりをば憚り給ふべきに、少者に左右なく、耻辱を與へられけるこそ遺恨の次第なれ。,"Sumitomo reported this to his grandfather, the ex-Prime Minister Jōkai. The priestly statesman erupted: 'Even for a prince, one should respect the precincts of Jōkai! To let youth shame us is an eternal regret.'"
11,19,かゝる事よりして、人にはあざむかるゝぞ。,Such deeds breed contempt.
11,20,此事思ひ知らせ奉らでは、えこそあるまじけれ。,"Had this been addressed properly, such a disgrace might have been avoided."
11,21,殿下を恨奉らばや。,Yet would we hold the prince accountable?
11,22,」とのたまへば、重盛卿申されけるは「是は少しも苦しう候まじ。頼政、光基など申源氏共にあざむかれて候はんには、誠に一門の耻辱でも候ふべし。重盛が子どもとて候はんずるものの、殿下の御出に參りあひて、乘物より下候はぬこそ尾籠に候へ。」とて、その時事にあうたる侍共めしよせ、「自今以後も、汝等よく／＼心得べし、誤て、殿下へ無禮の由を申さばやとこそ思へ。」とて歸られけり。,"Upon hearing this, Lord Shigemori replied: 'This is no grave matter. Should the Minamoto like Yoshiie or Moritsune scorn us, that would be true shame. As for my son's failure to dismount properly at the prince's procession—that alone warrants censure.' He summoned those present: 'From now on, serve with care. Should you offend His Highness again...' and departed."
11,23,その後、入道相國小松殿には仰られもあはせず、片田舎の侍どものこはらかにて、入道殿の仰より外は、又恐しき事なしと思ふ者ども、難波妹尾を始として、都合六十餘人召し寄せ、「来二十一日、主上御元服の御定めの爲に殿下御出あるべかんなり。いづくにても待かけ奉り、前驅御隨身共が髻きて、資盛が耻雪げ。」とぞのたまひける。,"Ignoring Kozukenosuke's orders, men who feared nothing but the priest-statesman gathered sixty retainers from Naniwa and Imbe: 'On the 21st, when His Majesty dons manhood, your Highness shall avenge Sumitomo's shame. We will await you anywhere!'"
11,24,殿下、是をば夢にもしろしめさず、主上、明年御元服、御加冠、拜官の御定のために、御直盧に暫く御座あるべきにて、常の御出よりも引き繕はせ給ひ、今度は待賢門より入御あるべきにて、中御門を西へ御出なる。,"Unaware of these plans, the prince prepared for the imperial Coming-of-Age ceremony. The emperor delayed his procession, intending to enter from Teien-mon and proceed west through Naka-no-Miya."
11,25,猪熊堀川の邊に、六波羅の兵ども、直冑三百餘騎待ち受け奉り、殿下を中に取りこめ參らせて、前後より一度に、鬨をどとぞつくりける。,"At Hikozuma by the Horikawa, over three hundred Rokkaku soldiers in full armor ambushed the procession. They surrounded the prince and raised a clamor."
11,26,前驅御隨身共が今日を晴としやうぞいたるを、あそこに追かけ、こゝに追つめ、馬よりとて引落し、散々に陵礫して、一々に髻をきる。,"The attendants, believing the day would proceed smoothly, were chased and beaten. Dragged from their horses, their heads shorn in humiliation."
11,27,随身十人中、右の府生武基が髻もきられにけり。,"Among ten attendants, Wakiya Takefusa's head was also shaved."
11,28,その中に、藤藏人大夫隆教が髻をきるとて、「是は汝が髻と思ふべからず、主の髻と思ふべし。」と、言ひ含めてきてけり。,"Tōjū, the elder chamberlain, upon having his head shaved, said: 'Do not mourn my locks—mourn your lord's.'"
11,29,其後,Afterward
11,30,に御車の内へも、弓の筈つき入れなどして、簾かなぐり落し、御牛の鞦、,"Even within the imperial carriage, arrows were loosed. The screens were torn down, and the ox yoke..."
11,31,胸懸切りはなち散々にし散して、悦のときをつくり、六波羅へこそ參りけれ。,"Breastplates shattered, they celebrated their triumph and returned to Rokkaku."
11,32,入道「神妙なり。」とぞのたまひける。,The priest-statesman declared: 'Divine intervention indeed.'
11,33,御車副には、因幡のさい使、鳥羽の國久丸といふをのこ、下臈なれども、なさけある者にて、泣々御車つかまつて、中御門の御所へ還御なし奉る。,"Only the attendant from Inaba, Kunihimaru of Toba, remained. Though a lower-ranking servant, he wept, retrieved the carriage, and returned it to Naka-no-Miya."
11,34,束帯の御袖にて、御涙をおさへつゝ、還御の儀式あさましさ、申すもなか／＼おろかなり。,"Clutching his court robe, he swallowed his tears. The return ceremony's disgrace rendered speech impossible."
11,35,大織冠、淡海公の御事は、擧げて申すに及ばず、忠仁公、昭宣公より以降、攝政関白の、かゝる御目にあはせ給ふ事、未だ承り及ばず。,"Even the Grand Chamberlain, Tamehito of Otomono-no-kami, could not voice his shock. The indignities heaped upon Chūnagon and other regents since Tadahira and Akiyoshi were beyond comprehension."
11,36,是こそ平家の惡行の始なれ。,This marked the beginning of the Heike's atrocities.
11,37,小松殿こそ大に噪がれけれ。,Kozukenosuke was greatly agitated.
11,38,行向ひたる侍共、皆勘当せらる。,All involved attendants were dismissed from service.
11,39,「たとひ入道如何なる不思議を下知し給とも、など重盛に夢をば見せざりけるぞ。凡は資盛奇怪なり、旃檀は二葉よりかうばしとこそ見えたれ。已に十二三歳にならむずる者が、今は禮義を存知してこそ振舞ふべきに、かやうに尾籠を現じて、入道の惡名を立つ、不孝のいたり、汝一人にありけり。」とて、暫く伊勢の国に追ひ下さる。,"Shigemori, who 'slept not a wink dreaming of Jōkai's decrees,' declared: 'Though strange indeed, how could a boy of twelve-three understand propriety? To display such insolence and stain Jōkai's reputation—this sole infamy rests on Sumitomo.' He was exiled to Ise."
11,40,さればこの大將をば、君も臣も御感ありけるとぞ聞えし。,"Thus, both sovereign and subject felt profound remorse for this great general."
12,0,是によて主上御元服の御定め、その日は延させ給ぬ。,"Therefore, regarding the scheduled Coming-of-Age Ceremony for His Majesty, that day was postponed."
12,1,同廿五日、院の殿上にてぞ、御元服の定めはありける。,"On the same twenty-fifth day, within the court of the Retired Emperor, there was indeed a decision regarding His Majesty's Coming-of-Age Ceremony."
12,2,攝政殿さても渡らせ給ふべきならねば、同十二月九日、兼宣旨をかうぶり、十四日太政大臣にあがらせ給ふ。,"If the Regent needed to cross over, then on December 9th of that year, a combined imperial command was issued, and on the 14th it was presented to the Grand Minister of State."
12,3,やがて同十七日慶申しありしかども、世の中はにが／＼し,"However, by the same seventeenth day, despite congratulations being exchanged, the world had grown bitter."
12,4,うぞ見えし。,A vague omen was seen.
12,5,さる程に今歳も暮ぬ。,"Thus, this year too is drawing to a close."

12,12,其比妙音院の太政のおほいとの、其時は未内大臣の左大將にてましましけるが、大將を辭し申させ給ふことありけり。,"At this time, the Left Major Captain of the Ministry of State Affairs (Minister Tadafusa Michinaga), who was also the nephew of Myōon-in Temple, resigned from his position."
12,13,時に徳大寺の大納言實定卿、その仁に當り給ふ由聞ゆ。,It is said that Naidaijin (Grand Councilor) Sadatada Michitsune of the Tōdai-ji family was considered for this role.
12,14,又花山院の中納言兼雅卿も所望あり。,"Additionally, Middle Counselor Kaneyoshi Kanetsugu of the Kazan-in line was also a candidate."
12,15,その外、故中御門の藤中納言家成卿の三男、新大納言成親卿もひらに申されけり。,"Furthermore, Shinnōdaijin (New Grand Councilor) Moronori Naritsune, the third son of the late Minister of the Center (Fujiwara no Michinaga), was proposed openly."
12,16,院の御氣色よかりければ、樣樣の祈をぞ始められける。,"As the Retired Emperor's disposition grew grave, various prayers were initiated."
12,17,先づ八幡に百人の僧を籠て、眞讀の大般若を七日讀ませられける最中に、甲良の大明神の御前なる橘の木に、男山の方より山鳩三つ飛來て、食ひ合ひてぞ死にける。,"First, at Hachiman Shrine, one hundred monks were sequestered to recite the Great Perfection Sutra for seven days.

12,23,「但し君／みにあらず、臣下のつし。」とぞ申ける。,"They stated, 'Though no direct threat to the sovereign exists, it signifies turmoil among subjects.'"
12,24,新大納言是に恐れをも致されず、は人目の滋ければ、夜な／歩行にて、中御門丸の宿所より、茂の上の社へ七夜けて参られけり。,"The New Grand Councilor Moronori, undeterred by fear, secretly visited the Upper Kamo Shrine every night from his residence at Nijō Uzumasa for seven consecutive nights."
12,25,七夜にずる夜、宿所に下向して、苦しに、うちふし、ちと目睡給へるに、茂の上の社へ参りたると思しくて、御殿の御戸推開き、ゆしくけだかげなる御にて花茂の川かぜうらむなよ、散るをばえこそとめざりけれ。,"On the seventh night, after descending to his lodging in distress, he fell into a troubled sleep. In a dream, he imagined himself entering the Upper Kamo Shrine and shouted with force: 'O sakura of the Kamo River! Do not blow away; let them scatter!'"
12,26,新大納言恐れをも致されず、茂の上の社に、あるをて、御殿の御後なる杉の洞にを立てて、吉尼の法を百日行はせられけるほどに、彼の大杉に雷落ちかり、雷火おびただしく燃え上て、宮中已に危く見えけるを、宮人ども多く走り集て、これを打消つ。,"Unyielding, the New Grand Councilor confined a holy man at the Upper Kamo Shrine and erected an altar behind the Imperial Palace's cedar grove to perform the Nagajin ritual for one hundred days. However, during this period, lightning struck the great cedar, causing violent flames that nearly consumed the palace. Many courtiers rushed to extinguish them."
12,27,かの外法行ひけるを、追出せんとしれば、「我當社に百日の大願あり、今日は七十五日になる。全く出まじ。」とてはたらかず。,"When authorities sought to expel the holy man, he replied: 'I have a great vow of one hundred days of seclusion at this shrine. Today marks only the 75th day—I cannot leave.' This plea was ultimately disregarded."
12,28,此の由を社家より内へ奏聞しれば「唯法に任せて追出せよ。」と宣旨を下さる。,"Upon reporting this to the palace, an imperial decree was issued: 'Let them act according to the law and expel him.'"
12,29,その時神人白杖を以て、彼がうなじをしらけ、一の大路より南へ追ひ出してけり。,"The shrine officials used a sacred staff to strike the holy man's neck,驱逐ing him south along Ichijō Avenue."
12,30,神は非をうけ給はずと申すに、この大納言、非分の大將を祈り申されければにや、かる不思議も出で来にけり。,"Though the shrine officials claimed 'the gods do not tolerate such disrespect,' it is said that this Grand Councilor's improper petition for military office brought about these strange occurrences."
12,31,其比の叙位除目と申は、院内の御はからひにもあらず、政関白の御成にも及ばず、唯一向平家のまにてありしかば、大寺、花山院もなり給はず、入道相國の嫡男小松殿、右大將にておはしるが、左に移りて、次男宗盛、中納言におはせし、數の上を超越して、右に加はられけるこそ、申すばかりもなかりしか。,"The promotions and demotions in question were not decreed by the Retired Emperor or even the Regent-Prime Minister, but solely favored the Taira faction. Not even the Tōdaiji and Kazan-in branches received favor—though Kiyomori's eldest son Shigemori was already Right Major Captain, he was transferred to the Left while his younger brother Munemori, a Middle Counselor, was promoted over senior officials to become Right Captain."
12,32,中にも大寺殿は、一の大納言にて華族、英雄、才雄長、家嫡にてまし／けるが、越えられ給けるこそ恨なれ。,"Among them, Tōdaiji-no-kami (Grand Councilor Michinaga), the foremost noble of distinguished lineage and unmatched talent, was deeply resentful of being surpassed."
12,33,定めて御出家などやあらむずらむと、人々内々は申あへりしかども、く世のならむ樣を見んとて、大納言をし申て、居とぞ聞えし。,"Though many privately suggested his retirement into monkhood, he initially declined to observe societal norms. Eventually, he resigned as Grand Councilor and retired to seclusion."
12,34,新大納言成親卿宣ひけるは、「大寺、花山院に越えられたらむは、いかせん。,"The New Grand Councilor Moronori declared, 'How shall I address being surpassed by the Tōdaiji and Kazan-in families?'"
12,35,平家の次男に越えらるこそ安からね。,But being surpassed by the second son of the Taira clan is tolerable.
12,36,是も萬づ思ふさまなるがいたす所也。,This is indeed a matter requiring utmost consideration.
12,37,いかにもして平家を亡し,"For truly, to destroy the Taira clan"
12,38,本望を遂げむ。,would fulfill my deepest desire.
12,39,」とのたまひけるこそ怖しれ。,This declaration struck terror into all who heard it.
12,40,父の卿は中納言までこそ至られしか。,"His father, the Lord, had only reached Middle Counselor rank."
12,41,その末子にて、位正二位、官大納言にあがり、大國あまた給はて、子息所從朝恩にれり。,"Yet this youngest son attained Senior Second Rank, Grand Councilor position, multiple provinces as fiefs, and boasted of imperial favor for himself and his retinue."
12,42,何の不足に、かる心つかれけん。,What more could he desire to cause such distress?
12,43,是偏に天魔の所爲とぞ見えし。,This seemed the work of a heavenly demon.
12,44,平治にも、越後中將とて、信頼卿に同心の間、既にせらるべかりしを、小松殿やう／に申て、首をつぎ給へり。,"During the Hōgen era, as Echizen Middle Captain, he was already poised to be executed alongside Minister Nobuyasu. However, through Shigemori's intercession, his head was severed."
12,45,然るにその恩を忘れて、外人もなき所に兵具をとのへ、兵を語らひおき、其みの外は他事なし。,"Yet he forgot this mercy, secretly gathering weapons and troops in private quarters—no other purpose than rebellion."
12,46,東山の麓鹿の谷といふ所は、後は三井寺にいて、ゆし城郭にてぞありける。,"The area below Mount Higashiyama, known as Shikagaya, later became a fortress connected to Mii-dera."
12,47,俊僧都の山庄あり。,This was the estate of Priest Jūkan (Minamoto no Yoshitomo).
12,48,かれに常は寄りあひ／、平家さむずるをぞしる。,"Here, conspiracies to destroy the Taira were often plotted."
12,49,或時法皇も御幸なる。,"At times, the Retired Emperor would visit."
12,50,故少納言入道信西が子息、法印御供仕る。,"The late Junior Counselor Shinzei's son, Priest Jōken, served as his attendant."
12,51,その夜の酒宴に、此由を法印に仰あはせられければ、「あなあさましや、人あまた承候。唯今漏きこえて、天下の大事に及び候ひなんず。」と大に噪ぎ申ければ、新大納言気色かはりて、さと立たれけるが、御前に候ける瓶子を、狩衣の袖にかけて引きたふされたりけるを、法皇「あれはいかに。」と仰せければ大納言立かへて、「平氏たふれ候ひ。」と申されける。,"At a drinking feast that night, when Jōken revealed this plan, he exclaimed: 'Alas! This secret has leaked. Now even matters of state shall be affected!' Startled, the New Grand Councilor abruptly stood and, clutching a bottle beneath his hunting robe sleeve, bowed before the Retired Emperor. When asked what this meant, he declared: 'The Taira must be destroyed.'"
12,52,法皇つぼに入らせおはしまして、「物どもて猿樂つかまつれ。」と仰すれば、平判官康頼りて、「あにへいじの多う候に、もて醉て候。」と申す。,"The Retired Emperor, entering his chamber, ordered: 'Bring performers for the sarugaku (court drama).' When Taira no Yorimori arrived drunk, he quipped: 'Ah, how many days of feasting remain!'"
12,53,俊僧都「さてそれをいか仕らむずる。」と申されければ、西光法師「を取るにはしかじ。」とて、瓶子の首を取てぞ入にける。,"When Jūkan asked, 'What shall we do now?' Priest Saikō replied, 'We must cut off their heads.' He promptly severed the bottle's neck and entered."
12,54,法印りのあさましに、つや／物も申されず。,"Jōken, overcome with terror, said nothing further."
12,55,返す／も恐しかりしとどもなり。,His very presence was now feared.
12,56,與力の誰々ぞ。,Among his allies were
12,57,近江中將入道俗名成正、法勝寺の行俊僧都、山城守基兼、式部大雅、平判官康頼、宗判官信房、,"Minister of mi (Yoshitomo's alias Ryōjō), Priest Jūkan of Hōshō-ji, Governor of Yamashiro Mototsune, Minister of the Left Office Masatane, Taira no Yorimori and Nobutaka"
12,58,新平判官資行、津國源氏多田藏人行を始として北面の多く與力したりけり。,"along with New Middle Captain Sadayuki and the Taira-aligned Minamoto retainers led by Tayada Kagetaka, forming a powerful faction."
13,0,此法勝寺の執行と申すは、京極の源大納言雅俊の卿の孫、木寺の法印寛雅には子なりけり。,"The executive official of Hōshō-ji referred to here is the son of Kanenori, the priest at Mokuradera—a grandson of Michitomo, Minister Ōno of the Minamoto family from Kyōgoku."
13,1,祖父大納言させる弓箭を取る家にはあらねども、あまりに腹あしき人にて、三條坊門京極の宿所の前をば、人をもやすく通さず、つねは中門にたゝずみ、齒をくひしばり、怒てぞおはしける。,"Though his grandfather, the late Minister Ōno, had been a house renowned for archery, this man was excessively irritable. At the entrance to the lodgings of Kyōgoku at Sanjō Bomon, he would not allow people to pass quickly, always making them wait at the middle gate, grinding his teeth in fury."
13,2,かゝる人の孫なればにや、この俊寛も僧なれども、心も猛くおごれる人にて、よしなき謀反にも與しけるにこそ。,"As the grandson of such a man, even though Sugawara was a priest, his heart was arrogant and wild. Thus he took part in many evil conspiracies."
13,3,新大納言成親卿は、多田の藏人行綱を呼て、「御邊をば、一方の大將に憑むなり。此事しおほせつるものならば、國をも庄をも所望によるべし。先づ弓袋の料に。」とて、白布五十端送られたり。,"The new Minister Narihira summoned Yukitsuna, the keeper of the Treasury at Tada, saying: 'Now that affairs of state rely on one great general, if you wish to settle this matter, claim provinces and estates as your due. First, here are fifty bolts of white cloth for bowcases.'"
13,4,安元三年三月五日、妙音院殿、太政大臣に轉じ給へるかはりに、大納言定房卿を越えて、小松殿、内大臣になり給ふ。,"On the fifth day of the third month of Angen three years, as Myōon-in was transferred to the post of Great Minister, Kozutsumi Hall's Lord Sadafusa was promoted over Dainagon, becoming Naidaijin (Chancellor of the Interior)."
13,5,大臣の大將めでたかりき。,The minister’s general was indeed celebrated.
13,6,やがて大饗行はる。,Then a great feast was held.
13,7,尊者には、大炊御門左大臣経宗公とぞ聞えし。,"The priestly lord was known as Lord Keimun, the Left Minister of the Great Kitchen Gate (Udaijin)."
13,8,一のかみこそ先途なれども、父宇治の惡左府の御例憚あり。,"Though one god might lead, there was fear of following the precedent of the evil Left Minister at Uji."
13,9,北面は上古にはなかりけり。,The Northern Guards did not exist in ancient times.
13,10,白河院の御時、始め置かれてより以降、衞府ども數多候けり。,"They were first established during the reign of Emperor Shirakawa. Since then, various guard units have multiplied."
13,11,爲俊、盛重、童より千手丸、、今犬丸とて、是等は左右なき切者にてぞありける。,"Yoshitomo, Morishige, and the boys—Thousand-Hand丸 and now Inu丸 (Dog丸)—these were all swordsmen without equal on either side."
13,12,鳥羽院の御時も、季教、季頼父子、共に朝家に召仕はれ伝奏する折もありなど聞えしかども、皆身の程をばふるまうてこそありしに、此時の北面の輩は、以外に過分にて、公卿殿上人をも物ともせず、禮儀禮節もなし。,"During Emperor Toba’s reign, both Keitō and Saizō served the court as messengers. Though they too acted according to their rank, these Northern Guards of today exceeded propriety: they treated even high-ranking nobles as nothing, disregarding all ceremony."
13,13,せず、禮儀禮節もなし。,There was no respect for protocol.
13,14,下北面より上北面にあがり、上北面より殿上の交を許さるゝ者もあり。,"Some lower Northern Guards rose to upper ranks, and even some were permitted to mingle in the palace."
13,15,かくのみ行はるゝ間、おごれる心どもも出きて、よしなき謀反にも與しけるにこそ。,"In this way, arrogance grew among them, leading even good men to join evil conspiracies."
13,16,中にも故少納言入道信西が許に召使ける師光成景といふものあり。,"Among these was Nagatoshi, the late Junior Secretary turned priest (Ninshō), who summoned a man named Shikō Naritsune to serve him."
13,17,師光は阿波の國の在廰、成景は京の者、熟根賤しき下臈なり。,"Shikō was a lowly retainer from Awa Province, while Naritsune was a commoner from Kyoto—both base-born attendants."
13,18,健兒童、もしは恪勤者などにて被召仕けるが、賢々しかりしによりて、師光は左衞門尉、成景は右衞門尉とて、二人一度に靱負尉になりぬ。,"Though they were summoned for their strength or diligence, these clever men rose swiftly: Shikō became Left Guards Captain, Naritsune Right Guards Captain, and both attained the rank of Armored Lieutenant."
13,19,信西が事にあひし時、二人ともに出家して、左衞門入道西光、右衞門入道西敬とて、此等は出家の後も、院の御倉預にてぞ在ける。,"When Ninshō’s affairs fell apart, both men became priests: Shikō as West Light (Saemon Nyūdō Saishō) and Naritsune as West Respect (Uemon Nyūdō Saikei). Even after their tonsure, they remained in charge of the retired emperor’s granaries."
13,20,かの西光が子に、師高といふ者あり。,The son of West Light was a man named Shitaka.
13,21,是も切者にて、檢非違使五位尉に歴上て、安元元年十二月廿九日、追儺の除目に加賀守にぞなされける。,"A skilled swordsman, he rose to Fifth-Rank Lieutenant of the Police and on the 29th day of the twelfth month of Angen one was appointed Governor of Kaga."
13,22,國務を行ふ間、非法非禮を張行し、神社佛寺、權門勢家の庄領を没倒し、散々の事共にてぞありける。,"During his tenure, he committed unlawful acts, seized estates of temples and powerful families, and perpetrated countless outrages."
13,23,假令せう公が跡を隔つといふとも、穩便の政を行ふべかりしに、かく心のまゝにふるまひし程に、同二年夏の比、國司師高が弟、近藤判官師経、加賀の目代に補せらる。,"Though he should have governed with moderation, acting thus led to his brother, Kondō no Jingi Shikin, being appointed deputy governor of Kaga in the summer of Angen two."
13,24,目代下著のはじめ、國府の邊に鵜川といふ山寺あり。,"When Shikin first arrived, there was a mountain temple called Ukawa near the provincial capital."
13,25,寺僧どもが境節湯をわかいて浴びけるを、亂入しておひあげ、我身あび、雜人共おろし、馬洗はせなどしけり。,"The monks, dividing the boundary spring for bathing, were interrupted: Shikin entered uninvited, bathed himself, threw commoners into the water, and even washed his horse there."
13,26,寺僧怒をなして、「昔より此處は國方の者入部することなし。速に先例に任せて、入部の押妨をとゞめよ。」とぞ申ける。,"The monks, enraged, declared: 'Never has a provincial official entered here. Act according to precedent and halt this intrusion!'"
13,27,「先先の目代は、不覺でこそいやしまれたれ。當目代はその儀あるまじ。唯法に任せよ。」といふ程こそありけれ、寺僧どもは、國方の者を追出せむとす。,"Though he argued, 'Former governors acted without care. We must follow law,' the monks resolved to expel provincial officials."
13,28,国方の者共は次を以て、亂入せんとす。,The officials then planned a counter-intrusion.
13,29,うちあひ張合ひしける程に、目代師経が秘藏しける馬の足をぞ打折りける。,"During the fracas, Shikin broke a leg of his hidden horse."
13,30,その後は互に弓箭兵仗をたいして、射合ひ截合ひ數刻戰ふ。,They then fought for several hours with bows and swords.
13,31,目代かなはじとや思ひけむ、夜に入て引退く。,"Shikin, realizing his peril, retreated at nightfall."
13,32,其後当國の在廰ども催し集め、其勢一千餘騎鵜川に押寄せて、坊舎一宇も殘さず燒拂ふ。,"He summoned provincial retainers, mobilized over a thousand men to Ukawa, and burned the temple to ashes."
13,33,鵜川といふは、白山の末寺なり。,Ukawa was a subsidiary temple of White Mountain (Hakusan).
13,34,この事訴へんとて進む老僧誰々ぞ。,Elder monks who sought to appeal this...
13,35,智釋、學明、寶臺房、正智、學音、土佐阿闍梨ぞ進みける。,"Including priests Chisetsu, Gakumei, Hōtairō, Shōchi, Gakon, and Tosa no Aratari."
13,36,白山三社、八院の大衆、悉く起りあひ、都合その勢二千餘人、同七月九日の暮方に、目代師経が館近うこそ押寄せたれ。,"With two thousand followers from White Mountain’s three shrines and eight temples, they attacked Shikin’s residence at dusk on the ninth day of the seventh month."
13,37,今日は日暮れぬ。,Today is not yet dusk.
13,38,明日の軍と定めて、その日はよせでゆらへたり。,They agreed to attack tomorrow and dispersed that day.
13,39,露ふき結ぶ秋風は、射向の袖を飜し、雲井を照す稻妻は冑の星を耀す。,"The autumn wind, thick with dew, billowed archers’ sleeves; lightning flashes above the well-lit helmets."
13,40,目代かなはじとや思ひけん、夜逃にして京へのぼる。,"Shikin, realizing his danger, fled secretly to Kyoto that night."
13,41,明くる卯刻に押寄て、閧をどとつくる。,"At dawn the next day, he attacked and breached the gate."
13,42,城の中には音もせず。,The castle was silent.
13,43,人を入れて見せければ、皆落て候と申す。,"Entering, he found all had fled."
13,44,大衆力及ばで引退く。,"The mob retreated, their strength spent."
13,45,然らば山門へ訴へんとて、白山中宮の神輿をかざり奉り、比叡山へふりあげ奉る。,They then carried the White Mountain Inner Shrine’s palanquin to Mount Hiei to appeal.
13,46,同八月十二日の午刻許、白山の神輿、既に比叡山東坂本につかせ給ふと云程こそありけれ。,"By the noon of the twelfth day of the eighth month, the White Mountain palanquin had reached Hiei’s Eastern Slope."
13,47,北國の方より雷おびたゞしく鳴て、都をさして鳴りのぼる。,Thunder rolled ominously from the northern provinces toward Kyoto.
13,48,白雪くだりて地を埋み、山上洛中おしなべて、常葉の山の梢まで皆白妙なりけり。,"Snow blanketed the land, covering peaks and valleys alike, even the summit of Mount Takanoe in pristine whiteness."
14,0,神輿をば、客人の宮へ入れ奉る。,The sacred palanquin was respectfully conveyed into the guest's residence.
14,1,客人と申は、白山妙理權現にておはします。,This 'guest' refers to Myōri Gongen of White Mountain (a divine entity).
14,2,申せば父子の御中なり。,"Upon inquiry, they were revealed as father and son within the divine presence."
14,3,先沙汰の成否は知らず、生前の御悦、只この事にあり。,"The outcome of prior deliberations is unknown; yet in life, their joy resided solely in this matter."
14,4,浦島が子の七世の孫に遭へり。,They encountered a seventh-generation descendant of Urashima's lineage.
14,5,しにも過ぎ、胎内の者の靈山の父を見しにも超えたり。,"Even surpassing the father of those in the womb, they beheld and transcended the sacred mountain's spirit."
14,6,三千の衆徒踵をつぎ、七社の神人袖を列ね、時々刻々の法施、祈念、言語道斷の事ども也。,"Three thousand followers followed closely; priests of the Seven Shrines arranged their sleeves. Moment by moment, ritual offerings, prayers, and unspeakable matters unfolded."
14,7,山門の大衆、國司加賀の守師高を流罪に処せられ、目代近藤判官師経を禁獄せらるべき由奏聞す。,The temple assembly petitioned to exile Governor Takatada of Kaga and imprison Judge Nakanishi Tadayoshi.
14,8,御裁斷遲かりければ、さも可然公卿殿上人は、「あはれとく御裁許あるべきものを、昔より山門の訴訟は他に異なり、大藏卿爲房、太宰の權帥季仲は、さしも朝家の重臣たりしかども、山門の訴訟によて、流罪せられにき。況や師高などは、事の數にやはあるべきに、子細にや及ぶべき。」と申あはれけれども、「大臣は祿を重んじて諫めず、小臣は罪に恐れて申さず。」といふ事なれば、各口を閉ぢたまへり。,"Delaying judgment, even court nobles lamented: 'It is pitiable that such a case should be adjudicated. From ancient times, temple litigations have been unique—Minister of the Treasury Arihira and Dazai no Gonno Suke Toshitada, though esteemed courtiers, were exiled due to temple disputes. How much more should Takatada deserve scrutiny?' Yet ministers prioritized their salaries over remonstrance, while lesser officials feared retribution into silence."
14,9,「賀茂川の水、雙六の賽、山法師、これぞ我心にかなはぬもの。」と白河院も仰なりけるとかや。,"It is said that Emperor Shirakawa lamented: 'The waters of the Kamo River, the dice of double-sixes, and mountain ascetics—none satisfy my heart.'"
14,10,鳥羽院の御時、越前の平泉寺を、山門へつけられけるには、當山を御歸依淺からざるによて、「非を以て理とす。」とこそ、宣下せられて、院宣をば下されけれ。,"During Emperor Toba's reign, when the temple of Hiraizumi in Echizen was annexed by the mountain order due to its shallow devotion, a decree was issued: 'Righteousness is deemed wrong.'"
14,11,江帥匡房卿の申されし様に、「神輿を陣頭へ振奉て、訴申さんには、君はいかゞ御計ひ候ふべき。」と申されければ、「げにも山門の訴訟はもだしがたし。」とぞ仰せける。,"When Lord Kōfū Michifusa advised, 'If the palanquin is paraded to the forefront for appeal, how shall Your Majesty proceed?' he was told: 'The temple's litigation has always been formidable.'"
14,12,去じ嘉保二年三月二日、美濃守源義綱朝臣、當國新立の庄を倒す間、山の久住者圓應を殺害す。,"On March 2, 1095, under orders to suppress a newly established estate in Mino Province, Minister Minamoto no Yoshitane killed the long-resident priest En'ō."
14,13,是によて日吉の社司、延暦寺の寺官、都合三十餘人、申文をささげて陣頭へ參じけるを後二條關白殿、大和源氏中務權少輔頼春に仰せてふせがせらる。,"Consequently, 30+ officials from Hiyoshi Shrine and Tōdai-ji submitted petitions to Lord Yoriharu of the Fujiwara clan, requesting intervention."
14,14,頼春が郎等矢を放つ。,Yoriharu's retainers loosed arrows.
14,15,矢庭に射殺さるゝ者八人、疵を被むる者十餘人、社司諸司四方へちりぬ。,Eight were killed in the arrow's path; ten more sustained injuries. Shrine officials scattered.
14,16,山門の上綱等、仔細を奏聞のために下洛すと聞えしかば、武士、検非違使、西坂本に馳向て、皆おかへす。,"Learning that temple elders had descended to the capital to petition, warriors and officials rushed to Nishiyama."
14,17,山門には、御裁斷遲々の間、七社の神輿を根本中堂に振上げ奉り、その御前にて、眞讀の大般若を七日讀で、関白殿を呪咀し奉る。,"During the delayed judgment, the Seven Shrine palanquins were enshrined in the Main Hall. For seven days, the entire Lotus Sutra was chanted to curse the Regent."
14,18,結願の導師には、仲胤法印、その比はいまだ仲胤供奉と申しが、高座に上り、かね打ならし、表白の詞にいはく、「我等なたねの二葉よりおふし立て給ふ神達、後二條の關白殿に、鏑矢一つ放ち当て給へ、大八王子權現。」と高らかにぞ祈誓したりける。,"Priest Chōin led the concluding rites. From his pulpit, he rang bells and declared: 'O gods invoked through our seven generations! Let one arrow from the Regent strike the Great Hachiman Shrine!'"
14,19,やがてその夜不思議の事あり。,"That very night, an ominous occurrence took place."
14,20,八王子の御殿より、鏑矢の聲いでて、王城をさしてなん行くとぞ、人の夢には見たりける。,"A bowshot was heard from Hachiman Shrine, aimed at the royal palace—a vision seen in dreams."
14,21,そのあした、関白殿の御所の御格子をあげけるに、只今山よりとてきたるやうに、露にぬれたる樒、一枝たたりけるこそ恐しけれ。,"The next morning, a cedar branch dripping with dew was found at the Regent's palace entrance—a clear omen from the mountains."
14,22,やがて山王の御咎めとて、後二條の関白殿、重き御病をうけさせ給ひしかば、母上、大殿の北の政所大に歎かせ給つゝ、御様をやつし、賤しき下臈のまねをして、日吉の社に御參籠あて、七日七夜が間祈申させ給けり。,"The mountain deity's wrath caused the Regent severe illness. His mother ordered seven days of fasting and prayers at Hiyoshi Shrine, disguised as a low-ranking attendant."
14,23,あらはれての御祈には、百番の芝田楽、百番の一物、競馬、流鏑馬、相撲各百番、百座の仁王講、百座の藥師講、一,"The revealed ritual demanded: 100 performances of azuma-asobi, 100 food offerings, horse races, archery, sumo (each 100 times), 100仁王護摩 and 薬師護摩 ceremonies, and"
14,24,ちやく手半の藥師百體、等身の藥師一體並に釋迦、阿彌陀の像、各造立供養せられけり。,"100 half-body药师 statues, one full-size 薬師, and 釈迦/阿弥陀 images to be constructed and enshrined."
14,25,又御心中に、三つの御立願あり。,"Additionally, three sacred vows were made:"
14,26,御心のうちの事なれば、人いかで知り奉るべき。,The innermost thoughts of the sovereign shall remain undisclosed.
14,27,それに不思議なりし事は、七日に滿ずる夜、八王子の御社にいくらもありける參人どもの中に、陸奧より遙々と上りたりける童神子、夜半ばかりに俄にたえ入けり。,"The mysterious event: On the seventh night, a child spirit from distant Mutsu appeared among worshippers at Hachiman Shrine."
14,28,遙かにかき出して祈りければ、程なくいき出て、やがて立て舞ひかなづ。,"Summoned through distant prayer, it emerged and performed a sacred dance."
14,29,人奇特の思をなして是を見る。,All marveled at this supernatural occurrence.
14,30,半時ばかり舞て後、山王おりさせ給て、やう／＼の御託宣こそ恐しけれ。,"After dancing for half an hour, it departed with a divine message:"
14,31,「衆生等確に承れ。,"Listen closely, all beings: "
14,32,大殿の北の政所、今日七日我が御前に籠らせ給たり。,The northern palace has fasted for seven days in my presence.
14,33,御立願三つあり。,Three vows were made:
14,34,一つには今度殿下の壽命,"First, to extend the Regent's life"
14,35,を助けてたべ、さも候はゞ、下殿に候ふ諸のかたはうどに交て、一千日が間、朝夕宮仕申さんとなり。,"if granted, His subjects shall serve the palace daily for a thousand days."
14,36,大殿の北の政所にて、世を世とも思し召さで、すごさせ給ふ御心に、子を思ふ道にまよひぬれば、いぶせきことも忘れて、あさましげなるかたはうどに交はて、一千日が間、朝夕宮仕申さむと仰せらるゝこそ、誠に哀に思しめせ。,"The sovereign's heart, longing to transcend worldly existence, decreed that despite parental duties, all shall serve the palace for a thousand days without distraction."
14,37,二つには、大宮の波止土濃より八王子の御社まで、囘廊作て參らせむとなり。,"Second, to construct a circumambulatory corridor from the main hall to Hachiman Shrine."
14,38,三千人の大衆、降にも照にも、社參の時いたはしうおぼゆるに、囘廊作られたらば、いかにめでたからん。,This would allow throngs of pilgrims to circulate smoothly instead of struggling through muddy paths.
14,39,三つには今度の殿下の壽命を助させ給はゞ、八王子の御社にて、法花問答講毎日退轉なく行べしとなり。,"Third, to hold uninterrupted Lotus Sutra lectures at Hachiman Shrine if the Regent's life is extended."
14,40,何れもおろかならねども、かみ二つはさなくともありなむ。,"Though seemingly trifling, these were sacred demands."
14,41,毎日法花問答講は、誠にあらまほしうこそ思召せ。,The sovereign especially desired the Lotus lectures to continue daily.
14,42,但今度の訴訟は、むげに安かりぬべき事にてありつるを、御裁許なくして、神人宮仕射殺され、疵を被り、泣く泣く參て訴申す事の餘に心憂て、如何ならむ世までも忘るべしともおほえず。,"Yet this litigation, far from trivial—having led to divine wrath and slain petitioners—I pray you remember the consequences."
14,43,その上かれらに當る處の矢は、しかしながら和光垂跡の御膚に立たるなり。,"For arrows aimed at sacred figures, though seemingly missed, struck the ground near divine statues."
14,44,誠か虚言か是を見よ。,Verify this for yourself:
14,45,」とて、肩ぬいだるを見れば、左の脇の下、大なるかはらけの口ばかりうげのいてぞ見えたりける。,Examining the arrow's path revealed a large wound on the left flank of the divine statue.
14,46,「是が餘に心憂ければ、如何に申とも、始終のことは叶ふまじ。法花問答講一定あるべくば、三年が命を延べて奉らむ。それを不足に思し召さば、力及ばず。」とて山王あがらせ給ひけり。,"The deity decreed: 'If my anger persists, even three years added to the Regent's life cannot suffice.'"
14,47,母上は御立願の事、人にも語らせ給はねば誰漏しつらむと、少しも疑ふ方もましまさず。,"The sovereign kept these vows secret, trusting no one."
14,48,御心の内の事どもを、ありのまゝに御託宣ありければ、心肝にそうて、ことに貴くおぼしめし、泣々申させ給けるは「縱ひ一日片時にて候ふとも、ありがたうこそ候ふべきに、まして三年,"When the divine message confirmed his innermost thoughts, he lamented: 'Even a single day of life is precious; how much more three years!'"
14,49,が命を延べて給らむ事しかるべう候ふ。,To receive this boon would be most auspicious.'
14,50,」とて、泣々御下向あり。,"And with tears, he prepared to fulfill the vows."
14,51,急ぎ都へ入せ給て、殿下の御領紀伊國に、田中庄といふ所を、八王子の御社へ永代寄進せらる。,"Urgently, the province of Kii's Tanaka Estate was permanently donated to Hachiman Shrine."
14,52,それよりして法花問答講、今の世に至るまで毎日退轉なしとぞ承る。,Lotus lectures have continued daily since then without interruption.
14,53,かゝりし程に、後二條關白殿、御病かろませ給て、もとの如くにならせ給ふ。,"Following this, the Regent's illness gradually abated and he recovered fully."
14,54,上下喜びあはれし程に、三年の過ぐるは夢なれや、永長二年になりにけり。,"In sorrowful joy, three years passed like a dream. By 1097 (Eichō 2),"
14,55,六月二十一日、又後二條の関白殿、御髮の際に惡しき御瘡出きさせ給て、同二十七日、御年三十八にて終にかくれさせ給ぬ。,"On June 21, the Regent developed a severe scalp infection. He passed away on the 27th at age 38."
14,56,御心の猛さ、理の強さ、さしもゆゝしき人にてましましけれ共、まめやかに事の急になりしかば、御命を惜ませ給ひける也。,"Though wise and resolute, the sovereign's hasty actions ultimately cost him his life."
14,57,誠に惜しかるべし。,Truly lamentable.
14,58,四十にだにも滿たせ給はで、大殿に先立まゐらせ給こそ悲しけれ。,"Had he lived to forty, surpassing his predecessor, it would have been glorious."
14,59,必ずしも父を先立つべしといふことはなけれども、生死のおきてに順ふならひ、萬徳圓滿の世尊、十地究竟の大士達も、力及び給はぬ事どもなり、慈悲具足の山王、利物の方便にてましませば、御咎めなかるべしとも覺えず。,"Though not required to precede his father in death, even enlightened beings and bodhisattvas cannot escape karma. The compassionate mountain deity might have spared him through skilful means."
15,0,さる程に山門の大衆、國司加賀守師高を流罪に處せられ、目代近藤判官師経を禁獄せらるべき由、奏聞度々に及ぶといへども、御裁許なかりければ、日吉の祭禮を打ち留めて、安元三年四月十三日辰の一點に、十禪師、客人、八王子三社の神輿かざり奉りて、陣頭へ振奉る。,"Thus, the masses of the mountain gate had repeatedly petitioned to exile Governor Michitaka, Kaga no kami, and imprison Nagamasa, Judge of the Deputy Governorship. Yet with imperial approval not granted, they halted the festival at Hiyoshi Shrine. On April 13th of Angen 3 in the hour of Dragon, ten Zen priests, guests, and palanquins bearing the triad shrines of Hachiman were paraded to the front lines."
15,1,下松、きれ堤、賀茂の川原、糺、梅たゞ、柳原、東北院の邊に、しら大衆、神人、宮仕、専当みち／＼,"From Shimamatsu, Kireshima堤 (Willow Dam), the Kamo riverbank, Tsuru (Cranes), Plum-only groves, Yanagihar (Willow Plains), and the outskirts of Higashinoin Temple—white-robed masses, shrine attendants, court officials, specialists filled these paths."
15,2,て、幾らといふ數を知らず、神輿は一條を西へいらせ給ふ。,"Though the number unknown, the palanquin was led west along Ichijo Avenue."
15,3,御神寶天にかゞやいて、日月地に落給かと驚かる。,"The divine treasures of heaven seemed to descend, causing awe that they might strike earth and sky."
15,4,是によて、源平兩家の大將軍、四方の陣頭を固めて、大衆防ぐべきよし仰下さる。,"Thus both Genji and Heike commanders-in-chief were ordered to secure all four fronts, intending to guard the masses."
15,5,平家には、小松の内大臣の左大將重盛公、其勢三千餘騎にて、大宮面の陽明、待賢、郁芳、三つの門をかため給ふ。,"For the Heike, Lord Shigemori, Left Major General and Minister of the Interior at Komatsu, with three thousand horsemen secured Yangmyo, Taiken, and Yoka gates facing Oomii."
15,6,弟宗盛、知盛、重衡、伯父頼盛、教盛、經盛などは、西南の陣を固められけり。,"Younger brother Munemori, Tomomori, Shigeharu, uncle Yoshimori, Norimori, Tsunemori secured the southwest camp."
15,7,源氏には、大内守護の源三位頼政卿、渡邊の省授をむねとして、その勢僅に三百餘騎、北の門、縫殿の陣を固め給ふ。,"For the Minamoto, Lord Yorimasa, Third Rank Guardian of the Inner Palace, relying on Watanabe no Shogaku, secured Northern Gate and Seiden Camp with barely three hundred horsemen."
15,8,處は廣し、勢は少し、まばらにこそ見えたりけれ。,"The ground was vast but their forces few, appearing scattered indeed."
15,9,大衆無勢たるによて、北の門、縫殿の陣より、神輿を入れ奉らんとす。,"Lacking numbers, they intended to enter the palanquin through Northern Gate and Seiden Camp."
15,10,頼政卿さる人にて、馬よりおり冑をぬいで、神輿を拜し奉る。,"Lord Yorimasa, such a man, dismounted and removed his helmet to bow before the palanquin."
15,11,兵ども皆かくの如し。,All warriors acted likewise.
15,12,衆徒の中へ使者を立てゝ、申送る旨あり。,A messenger was dispatched among the masses to deliver messages.
15,13,その使は、渡邊の長七唱と云者なり。,"This envoy was Nagazumi, known as Chou no Chu (Middle Seven) of Watanabe."
15,14,唱その日は、きちんの直垂に、小櫻を黄にかへいたる鎧著て、赤銅作の太刀を帯き、白羽の箭負ひ、滋籐の弓脇にはさみ、冑をばぬぎ高紐に掛け、神輿の御前に畏て申けるは、「衆徒の御中へ源三位殿の申せと候。今度山門の御訴訟、理運の條勿論に候。御成敗遅々こそよそにても遺恨に覺え候へ。さては神輿入れ奉らむこと仔細に及び候はず。但頼政無勢に候ふ。その上明けて入れ奉る陣より入せ給て候はば、山門の大衆は目たりがほしけりなど、京童の申候はむこと、後日の難にや候はんずらむ。神輿を入れ奉らば、宣旨を背くに似たり。又防ぎ奉らば年來醫王、山王に首を傾け奉て候ふ身が、今日より後、弓箭の道に分れ候ひなむず。彼と云ひ、此といひ、旁難治のやうに候。東の陣は、小松殿大勢で固められて候。其陣より入らせ給ふべうもや候ふらむ。」と、いひ送たりければ、,"That day Nagazumi wore formal court attire, armor dyed yellow with cherry blossoms, a crimson bronze sword, white-feathered arrows, and a bow case of bamboo slats. Removing his helmet, he tied it high on the cord before the palanquin's divinity, declaring: 'To our lords in the assembly—regarding this mountain temple litigation, though justice is self-evident, delay in judgment would breed regret. However, entering the palanquin requires no detailed explanation. Yet Lord Yorimasa has scant forces. Were we allowed entry through our own camp gates, as petitioned by Kyoto's youth, it might precipitate future conflict. Entering would resemble defying imperial decree; resisting would mean abandoning years of devotion to Iwashimizu and Hachiman shrines. This matter divides like tangled vines—eastern camps are securely guarded by Komatsu's great force. Might entry be permitted from their encampment?'"
15,15,唱がかくいふに防がれて、神人、宮仕暫くゆらへたり。,"When Nagazumi thus spoke, shrine attendants and courtiers hesitated momentarily."
15,16,若大衆共は、「何でうその義あるべき、只此陣より神輿を入れ奉れ。」といふ族多かりけれども、老僧のなかに、三塔一の僉議者と聞えし、攝津の堅者豪雲進み出て申けるは、「尤もさいはれたり。神輿を先立て參らせて、訴訟をいたさば、大勢の中をうち破てこそ、後代の聞えもあらむずれ。就中にこの頼政の卿は、六孫王より以降、源氏嫡々の正統、弓矢を取て未だ其不覺を聞かず。凡武藝にも限らず、歌道にも勝れたり。近衞院御在位の時、当座の御會ありしに、『深山花』といふ題を出されたりけるに、人々讀煩ひしに、此頼政卿、深山木のその梢とも見えざりし、櫻ははなにあらはれにけり。といふ名歌仕て、御感に預る程のやさしき男に、時に臨んで、いかがなさけなう耻辱をば與ふべき。此神輿かき返し奉れや。」と僉議しければ、數千人の大衆、先陣より後陣まで、皆尤々とぞ同じける。,"Though many young leaders cried, 'Why this false justice? Enter through our own camp!' an elder priest renowned as the sole consensus-builder among the Three Pagodas stepped forward from Settsu's stalwarts. 'Truly lamentable,' he declared. 'First parade the palanquin to negotiate litigation—only then can we break through their ranks, securing eternal renown. Especially this Lord Yorimasa, legitimate heir since Prince Sonshi of Minamoto lineage! Unmatched in martial arts and poetry—he once composed gloriously. Such a nobleman deserves no humiliation. Turn back the palanquin!' With this consensus, thousands from vanguard to rear instantly agreed."
15,17,さて神輿を先立てまゐらせて、東の陣頭待賢門より入れ奉らむとしければ、狼藉忽に出來て、武士ども散々に射奉る。,"When they attempted to first parade the palanquin through eastern camp's Taiken Gate, sudden chaos erupted. Warriors shot arrows recklessly."

15,21,大衆神輿をば、陣頭に振り棄て奉り、泣く／＼本山へ歸り上る。,"The masses abandoned the palanquin at the front lines, weeping their return to the main temple."

16,1,保安四年七月に、神輿入洛の時は座主に仰せて、赤山の社へ入れ奉る。,"In the seventh month of the fourth year of Hōan (1123), when the shrine palanquin entered the capital, the head priest was ordered to conduct it into the Akayama Shrine."
16,2,又保延四年四月に、神輿入洛の時,"Again, in the fourth year of Hōgen (1148), during the fourth month when the shrine palanquin entered the capital"
16,3,は、祇園の別當に仰せて、祇園の社へ入れ奉る。,the Director of the Gion Shrine was ordered to conduct it into the Gion Shrine.
16,4,今度は保延の例たるべしとて、祇園の別當權大僧都澄兼に仰て、秉燭に及で、祇園の社へ入奉る。,"This time, following the precedent of Hōgen, the Director of Gion Shrine (Gon-Daisōjō Morokane) was instructed to enter the shrine with a torchbearer, proceeding into the Gion Shrine."

16,8,「靈神怒をなせば、災害岐に滿つといへり。恐怖し恐怖し。」とぞ人々申合はれける。,"People warned: 'If the spiritual gods grow angry, calamities will fill the land. How dreadfully terrifying!'"
16,9,同十四日夜半ばかり、山門の大衆、又下洛すと聞えしかば、夜中に主上腰輿に召して、院の御所法住寺殿へ行幸なる。,"On the night of the fourteenth, when it was reported that the monks were descending from Mount Hiei again, the Emperor's portable litter was summoned at midnight for a progress to the cloistered emperor's residence at Hōjū-ji."

Monks sustained many injuries. The Great Hall, Second Hall, and all other buildings—none remained untouched by flames spreading through mountain and field. Three thousand monks deliberated collectively."
16,16,是によて大衆の申す所、御はからひあるべしと聞えしかば、山門の上綱等、子細を衆徒に觸れむとて、登山したりけるを、大衆おこて西坂本より皆おかへす。,"Having heard the monks' plea for imperial intervention, the senior monks climbed Mount Hiei to consult with their followers. But when the crowd revolted, they dispersed from Seizan."
16,17,平大納言時忠卿、その時はいまだ左衞門督にておはしけるが、上卿に立つ。,"At this time, Minister of the Left (Hiraizumi Tadafusa), then serving as Major Captain of the Left Guards, was appointed chief envoy."

16,24,是を見て、ひはるに及ばず、皆尤々と同じて、谷々へおり、坊々へぞ入にける。,"Without delay, all united and dispersed into the valleys and temples."
16,25,一紙一句をもて、三塔三千の憤をやすめ、公私の耻を逃れ給へる時忠卿こそゆゝしけれ。,"With these words, Tadafusa appeased the wrath of three thousand monks at the Three Towers and averted public and private disgrace."

However, if there are envoys of the pursuit and escort mission, it would be difficult to act without mishap; there is no other power than that of Sanno Daishi.

Even though it is the end of an era, how can we allow our mountain's executioner to be transferred elsewhere? I am deeply troubled eternally. 'Even if I leave traces at this foot of the mountain, what use would that be?' he said, pressing his sleeves to his face and letting tears flow down."
18,3,大衆これをあやしみて、「誠に十禪師權現の御託宣にてあらば、我等驗を參らせん、少しもたがへず元の主に返し給へ。」とて、老僧共四五百人、手手に持たる數珠どもを、十禪師の大床の上へぞ投上たる。,"The crowd marveled, saying, 'Truly, if this is a divine revelation from Zenji Gongen (Zen Master), let us test its power and return to our original lord without delay.'

How can we delay when there is an official decree to expel them from the capital? Let the monks return.' Addressing those nearby: 'Since I emerged from the Three Seats and Paulownia Gates, studied the teachings of the Lotus School through the Four Bright Windows and Mysterious Stream, mastered both Esoteric and Exoteric Buddhism, devoted myself solely to the prosperity of my mountain, never neglecting prayers for the nation, nurturing disciples with deep resolve... If I am punished without cause, I will hate all beings in this world. The sincerity of these monks who have come today deserves our utmost gratitude.' Without even tying the sash on his fragrant robe, he wept, and so did the crowd."
18,13,御輿さしよせて、「とうとうめさるべう候。」と申すれば、「昔こそ三千の衆徒の貫首たりしが、今はかゝる流人の身と成て、如何がやごとなき修學者、智慧深き大衆達には舁捧られては上るべき。縱のぼるべきなり共、鞋などいふ物をしばりはき、同樣に歩續いてこそ上らめ。」とてのり給はず。,"When the palanquin was offered and they said, 'You should ascend,' he replied: 'Once I led three thousand disciples, now a mere exile. How can I dare ride in this manner before wise scholars? Even if ascent is permitted, let me bind my shoes like them and walk uniformly.' He refused to board."

'Make way!' he bellowed, pushing through the crowd to where the senior priest resided."
18,16,大の眼を見瞋し、暫にらまへ奉り、「その御心でこそ、かゝる御目にも逢せ給へ。,"With eyes blazing, he approached immediately: 'By your will, may even your eyes meet this form again."
18,17,とう／＼召,However—
18,18,るべう候。,I pray...
18,19,」と申ければ、怖さに急ぎのり給ふ。,"He was about to speak when, terrified, the senior priest quickly entered."
18,20,大衆取得奉る嬉さに、賤き法師原にはあらで、止事なき修學者ども、舁捧奉り喚き叫んで上けるに、人はかはれ共祐慶はかはらず、前輿舁て、長刀の柄も輿の轅も、碎けよと取まゝに、さしも嶮しき東坂平地を行が如く也。,"The crowd, elated at their success, carried even lowly monks like Yasuhara on palanquins, shouting as they ascended. While others faltered, Yukke forced his way forward, the spear shaft and palanquin yoke cracking like ascending a steep eastern slope."
18,21,大講堂の庭に輿舁居て、僉議しけるは、「抑我等粟津に行向て、貫首をば奪とゞめ奉りぬ。すでに勅勘を蒙りて、流罪せられ給ふ人をとりとゞめ奉て、貫首に用申さん事、如何有べからん。」と僉議す。,"In the Great Lecture Hall courtyard, they debated: 'We must go to Awazu and seize the executioner. Though already exiled for imperial censure, how shall we use this man as our leader?'"
18,22,戒淨坊阿闇梨、又先の如くに進み出て僉議しけるは、「夫當山は日本無雙の靈地、鎭護國家の道場、山王の御威光盛にして、佛法王法牛角也。されば衆徒の意趣に至るまで、雙なく、賤き法師原までも、世以て輕しめず。況や智慧高貴にして、三千の貫首たり。今は徳行おもうして一山の和尚たり。罪なくして罪を蒙る。是山上洛中の憤り、興福園城の嘲に非ずや。此時顯密の主を失て、數輩の學侶、螢雪の勤怠らむ事心うかるべし。詮ずる所、祐慶張本に稱せられ、禁獄流罪もせられ、首を刎られん事、今生の面目冥土の思出なるべし。」とて、雙眼より涙をはら／＼と流す、大衆尤々とぞ同じける。,"Yukke again stepped forward: 'This mountain is Japan's incomparable sacred site, a temple protecting the nation under Sanno's great glory—the horn of Buddhist and imperial law. Our disciples' devotion knows no equal; even Yasuhara, though worldlyly slighted, remains unbroken. How much more our noble leader with wisdom surpassing three thousand? Now falsely accused and exiled... This is not merely the anger of Kyoto but mockery by Enryaku-ji! Should we lose our master of Esoteric and Exoteric teachings? Disciples laboring through萤雪 (lamp-oil snow) will despair. If Yukke becomes our standard bearer, facing imprisonment or decapitation, what face can he show in this life or the next?' Tears streamed from his eyes as the crowd sympathized deeply."
18,23,其よりしてこそ、祐慶をばいかめ房とはいはれけれ。,"Henceforth, Yukke was no longer called 'the blacksmith's hut' but..."
18,24,其弟子に慧慶律師をば、時の人小いかめ房とぞ申ける。,His disciple Eike (Ei-ke) was known as 'the little blacksmith's hut.'
18,25,大衆先座主をば、東塔の南谷、妙光坊へ入奉る。,The senior priest entered Myōkō-in Temple in the South Valley of the East Tower.
18,26,時の横災は、權化の人ものがれ給はざるやらん。,These calamities surely indicated divine retribution upon arrogant men.
18,27,昔大唐の一行阿闍梨は、玄宗皇帝の御持僧にて坐けるが、玄宗の后楊貴妃に名をたち給へり。,"Long ago, in Tang China, the monk Ippen (Yi-pen) served Emperor Xuanzong but was falsely accused by his concubine Yang."
18,28,昔も今も、大國も小國も、人の口のさがなさは、跡形なき事なりしかども、その疑に依て、果羅國へ流されさせ給ふ。,"Throughout history, great and small nations suffer from baseless rumors. Though without evidence, Ippen was exiled to Guo-la Province."
18,29,件の國へは三つ道有り。,That province had three routes:
18,30,輪池道とて、御幸道、幽地道と,"1. The Round Pond Road (royal procession route),"
18,31,て、雜人の通ふ道、暗穴道とて、重科の者を遣す道なり。,"2. The Secret Path for commoners,"
18,32,されば彼一行阿闇梨は大犯の人なればとて、暗穴道へぞ遣しける。,"As a major offender, Ippen was sent via the Dark Hole Road."
18,33,七日七夜が間、月日の光をみずして行道なり。,For seven days and nights he traveled without moonlight or sun.
18,34,冥々として人もなく、行歩に前途迷ひ、森森として山深し。,"In pitch darkness, lost in trackless mountains..."
18,35,唯,Only—

18,37,澗谷に鳥の一聲計にて、苔のぬれ衣ほしあへず、無實の罪に依て、遠流の重科を蒙むる事を、天道憐み給ひて、九曜の形を現じつゝ、一行阿闍梨を守り給ふ。,"The cry of a bird in the ravine revealed his path. Moved by compassion, Heaven manifested the Nine Stars' pattern to protect Ippen, whose damp robe clung to him as he bore this unjust exile."
18,38,時に一行右の指を噬切て、左の袂に九曜の形を寫されけり。,"At that moment, Ippen's right finger was severed, its blood forming the Nine Stars' pattern on his left sleeve."
18,39,和漢兩朝に眞言の本尊たる九曜の曼陀羅是也。,"This is the True Word's fundamental mandala of the Nine Stars, revered in both Japan and China."

19,0,大衆先座主を取とゞむる由、法皇聞召て、いとゞやすからずぞおぼしめされけり。,"When the assembly's headmaster was summoned, upon hearing this, the Retired Emperor could not but sigh deeply and lament."
19,1,西光法師申けるは、「山門の大衆、亂がはしき訴仕る事、今にはじめずと申ながら、今度は以の外に覺候。これ程の狼藉いまだ承り及候はず。能々御誡め候へ。」とぞ申ける。,"The West Light Monk declared: 'Though the mountain temple's assembly claims they have not begun their rebellion, now they are aware of it. Such chaos has never been heard before. Please warn Your Majesty immediately.'"
19,2,身のたゞ今滅びんずるをもかへりみず、山王大師の神慮にもかゝはらず、か様に申て宸襟を惱し奉る。,"Ignoring my own imminent demise and disregarding the divine will of Mount Hikawa's Great Master, I speak thus to trouble Your Imperial Majesty's heart."
19,3,讒臣は國を亂ると云へり。,"A traitorous minister brings chaos to the nation, as they say."
19,4,実なる哉、「叢蘭茂からんとすれども、秋の風是を敗り、王者明ならんとすれば、讒臣是を暗す。」とも、か様の事をや申べき。,"Truly, 'Though a thicket of orchids may grow lush, autumn's wind shall wither it; where a wise king reigns, traitors will obscure his light.' Such matters should be spoken plainly."
19,5,此事新大納言成親卿以下近習の人々に仰合せられ、山責らるべしと聞えしかば、山門の大衆さのみ王地に孕れて、詔命をそむくべきにあらずとて、内々院宣に隨奉る衆徒もありなど聞えしかば、前座主明雲大僧正は妙光坊に坐けるが、大衆二心有ときいて、「終に如何なる目にか逢はむずらん。」と、心細げにぞ宣ける。,"When this matter was ordered by the New Dainagon Naritsune and his attendants, with rumors that the mountain temple's assembly would be punished—though they should not defy imperial decree as some followers of the inner court orders supposedly do—the former headmaster Myoren Daikushō, seated at Myōkō Temple upon learning of the assembly's divided loyalties, lamented: 'Alas, what dire sights we shall witness in the end.'"
19,6,さ,Sa
19,7,れども流罪の沙汰はなかりけり。,"However, there was no talk of exile."
19,8,新大納言成親卿は、山門の騒動に依て、私の宿意をばしばらくおさへられけり。,"The New Dainagon Naritsune, due to the turmoil at the mountain temple, temporarily suppressed his long-held grievances."
19,9,そも内議支度は様々なりしかども、義勢計にては、此謀反叶ふべうも見えざりしかば、さしも憑れたりける多田藏人行綱、無益なりと思ふ心附にけり。,"Though imperial council preparations varied, Yoshimori's calculations showed no hope for this rebellion succeeding. Thus, despite Tada Kurō Yukitsuna's eager involvement, I deemed him useless."
19,10,弓袋の料に、送られたりける布共をば、直垂帷に裁縫せて、家子郎等共に著せつゝ、目うちしばたゝいて居たりけるが、倩平家の繁昌する有様をみるに、當時輙く傾けがたし。,"Using cloth meant for quivers to sew straight-sleeved cloaks for my retainers, keeping watch through narrow gaps in the curtains—though I marveled at the flourishing state of the Heike clan, the times seemed fated to collapse."
19,11,由なき事に與してけり。,I became entangled in matters beyond my control.
19,12,若此事もれぬる物ならば、行綱まづ失はれなんず。,"Had this not been discovered, Yukitsuna himself would surely have been lost first."
19,13,他人の口より漏れぬ先に廻忠して、命生うと思ふ心ぞ附にける。,"I resolved to report this before others泄露ed it, clinging to the hope of saving my life."
19,14,同五月二十九日の小夜深方に、多田藏人行綱、入道相國の西八條の亭に參て、「行綱こそ申べき事候間參て候へ。」と、いはせければ、入道「常にも參らぬ者が參じたるは何事ぞ。あれきけ。」とて、主馬判官盛國を出されたり。,"On the late evening of May 29th, Tada Kurō Yukitsuna came to the West Hachijō residence of Retired Regent-in-Dress Iemori. 'I have urgent matters to report,' he said. When this unexpected visit surprised Iemori—who remarked, 'Who comes at such an hour? This must be grave indeed'—he summoned Master of Horse Morikuni."
19,15,「人傳には申まじき事也。」といふ間、さらばとて、入道自中門の廊へ出されたり。,"Upon hearing, 'This must not be spoken through intermediaries,' Iemori himself went to the middle gate corridor."
19,16,「夜は遙に更ぬらん、唯今如何に、何事ぞや。」とのたまへば、「晝は人目の繁う候間、夜に紛れ參て候。此程に院中の人々の兵具を調へ、軍兵を召され候をば、何とか聞召されて候。」「其は山攻めらるべしとこそきけ。」といと事もなげにぞのたまひける。,"When asked, 'The night is late; what brings you here?' Yukitsuna replied: 'During the day, many eyes watch. I came at night to inspect Your Retired Lord's arms and summon troops. If they are mobilized, pray inquire—surely this means an attack on the mountain temple.'"
19,17,行綱近うより、 小聲に成て申けるは、「其儀にては候はず、一向御一家の御上とこそ承り候へ。」「さて其をば法皇も知召されたるか。」「仔細にや及び候。成親卿の軍兵催され候も、院宣とてこそ召され候へ。俊寛がと振舞て、康頼がかう申て、西光がと申て。」など云ふ事共、始よりありの儘には指過ていひ散し、暇申てとて出にけり。,"Whispering from close proximity, Yukitsuna added: 'This matter concerns your immediate household alone. Does the Retired Emperor know of it? The details are as follows: Naritsune's troops have been mobilized by imperial decree—Shunkan advised, Kōrai reported, and West Light spoke.' After this unvarnished account, he left."
19,18,入道大に驚き大聲をもて、,"The Retired Regent-in-Dress was greatly alarmedled, shouting:"
19,19,侍共よびのゝしり給ふ事聞もおびたゞし。,Upon hearing the retainers summoned in alarm:
19,20,行綱なまじひなる事申出して證人にや引れんずらんとおそろしさに、大野に火を放たる心地して、人も追はぬに執袴して、急ぎ門外へぞにげ出ける。,"Terrified Yukitsuna, fearing his own words would incriminate him as a witness, acted rashly—like setting fire to the Nō field to escape pursuit, he fled through the gate without being detained."
19,21,入道、先づ貞能を召て、「當家傾うとする謀反の輩、京中に滿々たんなり。一門の人々にも觸申、侍共催せ。」と宣へば、馳廻て催す。,The Retired Regent first summoned贞能 (Sadanori): 'Rebellious traitors swarm Kyoto. Notify all household members and summon the guards at once!' Orders were swiftly carried out.
19,22,右大將宗盛卿、三位中將知盛、頭中將重衡、左馬頭行盛以下の人々、甲冑を鎧ひ、弓箭を帶し馳集る。,"From Right General Munemori, Third Middle Captain Tomonori, Head Middle Captain Naomori, Left Horse Captain Yukimori onward—all donned armor and arrows, rallying in haste."
19,23,其外軍兵雲霞の如くに馳つどふ。,Outside forces swarmed like cloud-veil mists.
19,24,其夜の中に西八條には、兵ども六七千騎も有らんとこそ見えたりけれ。,"That night, West Hachijō's grounds reportedly held six to seven thousand mounted soldiers."
19,25,明れば六月一日なり。,Dawn broke on June 1st.
19,26,未暗かりけるに、入道、検非違使安倍資成をめして、「きと院の御所へ參れ。信成を招いて申さんずる樣はよな、近習の人々、此一門を亡して天下を亂らんとする企あり。一々に召取て、尋沙汰仕るべし。夫をば君も知召るまじう候と申せ。」とこそ宣けれ。,"Before full darkness, the Retired Regent sent 検非違使 (kebiishi) Abe Yoshinari: 'Go to the Retired Emperor's palace. Summon Shinzō and investigate—our household conspirators seek to overthrow us and chaos the realm. Question them thoroughly; inform no one.'"
19,27,資成急ぎ馳參り、大膳大夫信成喚出いて、此由申に、色を失ふ。,"Yoshinari rushed to summon 大膳大夫 (Daisenbutō) Shinzō, who paled upon hearing the accusations."
19,28,御前へ參て、此よし奏聞しければ、法皇、「あは此等が内々計りし事の、泄にけるよ。」と思召にあさまし。,"Reporting to the Retired Emperor, Shinzō's account led the sovereign to lament: 'Alas, these inner court machinations have been exposed.'"
19,29,さるにても、「こは何事ぞ。」とばかり仰られて、分明の御返事もなかりけり。,"Yet when asked, 'What is this matter?' the Retired Emperor gave no clear response."
19,30,資成急ぎ馳歸て、入道相國に此由申せば、「さればこそ。行綱は、實をいひけり。此事行綱知らせずば、淨海安穩にあるべしや。」とて、飛騨守景家、筑後守貞能に仰て、謀反の輩、搦捕べき由下知せらる。,"Yoshinari returned to report: 'Thus it is. Yukitsuna has confessed. If he were not informed, the Pure Sea (Temple) might remain secure.' 景家 (Keijō) 飛騨守 and 貞能 (Sadanori) 筑後守 were ordered to apprehend the rebels."
19,31,仍二百餘騎、三百餘騎、あそここゝに押寄々々搦捕る。,"Scores of riders—200 here, 300 there—converged to surround and arrest."
19,32,太政入道先雜色をもて、中御門烏丸の新大納言成親卿の許へ、「申合すべき事あり。きと立寄給へ。」とのたまひつかはされたりければ、大納言我身の上とは、露しらず、「あはれ是は法皇の,"The Retired Regent, 中御門烏丸 (Nakamikado Uzumasa) 新大納言成親卿 (Naritsune), was summoned: 'Matters await discussion. Come at once.' Without concealing his plight, he lamented: 'Alas, this is the Retired Emperor's'"
19,33,山攻らるべきよし、御結構有を、申とゞめられんずるにこそ。,"attack on the mountain temple—though well-intentioned, we could not petition for it."
19,34,御いきどほり深げ也。,The sovereign's resolve was unshakable.
19,35,如何にもかなふまじきものを。,What dire consequences this brought!
19,36,」とて、ないきよげなる布衣たをやかに著なし、鮮なる車に乘り、侍三四人召具して、雜色牛飼に至るまで、常よりも引繕れたり。,"Dressed hastily in a plain robe, he boarded a fine carriage with three attendants, proceeding farther than usual to 雜色牛飼 (Zasshoku Uguisu) for protection."
19,37,そも最後とは後にこそおもひ知れけれ。,The final outcome became clear only later.
19,38,西八條近う成て見給へば、四五町に軍兵滿々たり。,"Approaching West Hachijō, one saw five cho (about six kilometers) of soldiers packed tightly."
19,39,あな夥し。,Indeed formidable!
19,40,こは何事やらんと、胸打騒ぎ、車より下り、門の内に差入て見給へば、内にも、兵共隙はざまも無ぞ滿々たる。,"Pounding his chest in alarm, he descended the carriage to inspect. Inside the gate, soldiers filled every space without respite."
19,41,中門の口に怖げなる武士共、數多待受て、大納言の左右の手を取て引張り、「縛べう候らん。」と申、入道相國簾中より見出して、「有べうもなし。」とのたまへば、武士共前後左右に立圍み、縁の上に引のぼせて、一間なる處に押籠てけり。,"At the middle gate, fearsome warriors seized his arms: 'We must arrest you!' When the Retired Regent emerged from behind screens to deny this, attendants surrounded him, hoisted him onto the veranda railing, and confined him in a single space."
19,42,大納言夢の心地して、つや／＼物もおぼえ給はず。,"The 大納言 (Dainagon) was as dazed as one in a dream, forgetting even his own reflection."
19,43,供なりつる侍共、押隔られて、散々に成ぬ。,His attendants were scattered by force.
19,44,雑色牛飼色を失ひ、牛車を捨て逃去ぬ。,"Zasshoku Uguisu lost color, abandoning the carriage to flee."
19,45,さる程に、近江中將入道蓮淨、法勝寺執行俊寛僧都、山城守基兼、式部大輔正綱、平判官康頼、宗判官信房、新平判官資行も、捕れて出來たり。,"Under such circumstances, 近江中將 (Ōmi Middle Captain) 蓮淨, 法勝寺執行 (Hōshōji Executive) 俊寛僧都, 山城守 (Yamashiro Governor) 基兼, 式部大輔 (Shikibu Daijin) 正綱, 平判官 (Hei no Hakase) 康頼 and 宗判官信房, 新平判官資行—all were apprehended."
19,46,西光法師此事聞て、我身の上とや思ひけん、鞭を擧院の御所法住寺殿へ馳參る。,"Hearing this, 西光法師 (West Light Monk) wondered of his own fate, galloping to 法住寺殿 (Hōjūji Hall) with whip in hand."
19,47,平家の侍共、道にて馳向ひ、「西八條へ召るゝぞ。きと參れ。」と言えば、「奏すべき事有て、法住寺殿へ参る。軈てこそ參らめ。」と云ければ、「惡い入道哉。何事をか奏すべかんなる。さないはせそ。」とて、馬より取て引落し、中に縛て、西八條へさげて參る。,"Heike retainers intercepted him on the road: 'We must take you to West Hachijō! Come at once!' Declaring, 'I have matters to report to 法住寺殿. I cannot come now,' they seized him, bound him, and dragged him to West Hachijō."
19,48,日の始より根元與力の者なりければ、殊によう縛て、坪の内にぞ引居たる。,"Since morning, 根元与力 (Nemoto Yūryō) loyalists had been bound tightly and dragged into the courtyard."
19,49,入道相國大床に立て、「入道傾うとする奴が,The Retired Regent-in-Dress stood on the 大床 (main floor): 'Traitorous scoundrels plotting against me—
19,50,なれる姿よ。,Such a spectacle!
19,51,しやつ爰へ引寄よ。,Bring them here! Quickly!
19,52,」とて、縁のきはに引寄させ、物はきながら、しや頬をむずむずとぞふまれける。,"They were hauled to the veranda edge. Though silent, their cheeks burned with shame."
19,53,「本より己らが樣なる下臈の果を君の召仕はせ給ひて、なさるまじき官職をなし給び、父子ともに過分の振舞をすると見しに合せて、過たぬ天台座主流罪に申行ひ、天下の大事引出いて、剩へ此一門ほろぼすべき謀反に與してける奴なり。有のまゝに申せ。」とこそのたまひけれ。,"The Retired Regent declared: 'For years I promoted your ilk to positions they did not deserve. You schemed with my sons, committed forbidden acts, and invoked the Tendai sect's authority to foment rebellion against our house. Speak truthfully!'"
19,54,西光元より勝れたる大剛の者なりければ、ちとも色も變ぜず、惡びれたる景気もなし。,"Though 西光 (West Light) was a resolute man, his expression never wavered; no trace of fear."
19,55,居直り、あざ笑て申けるは、「さもさうず、入道殿こそ過分の事をばのたまへ。他人の前はしらず、西光が聞ん處に左樣の事をば、えこそのたまふまじけれ。院中に召仕るる身なれば、執事の別当成親卿の院宣とてもよほされし事に與せずとは申べき様なし。それは與したり。但し耳に留まる事をも宣ふ物かな。御邊は故刑部卿忠盛の子で坐しか共、十四五までは出仕もし給はず、故中御門藤中納言家成卿の邊に立入り給ひしをば、京童部は高平太とこそ言しか。保延の頃、大將軍承り海賊の張本三十餘人、搦進ぜられたりし賞に四品して、四位の兵衞佐と申ししをだに、過分とこそ時の人々は申合れしか。殿上の交をだに嫌はれし人の子孫にて太政大臣迄なりあがたるや過分なるらむ。侍品の者の、受領檢非違使に成る事、先例傍例なきに非ず。なじかは過分なるべき。」と憚る所なう申ければ、入道餘にいかて、物も宣はず。,"Kneeling formally, he mocked: 'Alas, Your Retired Lord speaks too harshly. Though I have heard no such things in public, your words to me suggest... As a servant of the court, I have always obeyed orders—even when 成親卿's edicts conflicted with my conscience. Regarding your family: though 忠盛 was my grandfather (刑部卿), I served until age 14 under 藤中納言家成. The masses called me 高平太. During 保延's reign, for routing 30 pirates, I was granted four court ranks—excessive, say some. Yet a descendant of the despised 殿上 (imperial guards), I rose to 太政大臣—a precedent? Perhaps excessive. But promoting retainers to 檢非違使 is not unprecedented.' After this measured reply, the Retired Lord said nothing more."
19,56,斬し有て「しやつが頸左右なう切な。よく／＼戒めよ。」とぞ宣ける。,The order came: 'Cut off this scoundrel's head! Warn them well!'
19,57,松浦太郎重俊承て、足手を挾み様々に痛問ふ。,Matsuura Taro Shigetoshi was subjected to excruciating foot-and-hand torture.
19,58,本より争がひ申さぬ上、糺問は緊かりけり。,"Without prior dispute, the interrogation grew intense."
19,59,残なうこそ申けれ。,The remainder must confess...
19,60,白状四五枚に記され、やがて、しやつが口をさけとて、口を裂れ、五條朱,"After five written confessions, the scoundrel's lips split open—a crimson gash across his fivefold throat."
19,61,雀にて、きられにけり。,He was beheaded by 雀 (a ceremonial axe).
19,62,嫡子前加賀守師高、尾張の井戸田へ流されたりけるを、同國の住人小胡麻の郡司維季に仰て討れぬ。,"His heir, former Kaga Governor 師高, exiled to Ido田 in Owari, was executed by district official 小胡麻維季."
19,63,次男近藤判官師経禁獄せられけるを、獄より引出され、六條河原にて誅せらる。,"Second son 近藤判官 (Kondō Hakase) 師経, after imprisonment, was executed at 六條河原."
19,64,其弟左衞門尉師平、郎等三人、同く首を刎られけり。,His younger brother 左衛門尉 (Hyōgo no suke) 師平 and three retainers were beheaded.
19,65,是等は云甲斐なき者の秀て、いろふまじき事に綺ひ、あやまたぬ天台座主流罪に申行ひ、果報や盡にけん、山王大師の神罰冥罰を立處に蒙て、斯る目に逢へりけり。,"These men, called 'worthless flowers,' having woven a cursed tapestry of evil deeds, invoked the Tendai sect's divine wrath. Their retribution was swift—punished by the mountain deity's earthly and underworld curses, they met this fate."
20,0,新大納言は一間なる所に押籠られ、汗水に成りつゝ、あはれ是は日比の有まし事の洩聞えけるにこそ。,"The new Grand Councilor was confined in a single tatami room, drenched in sweat. 'Alas! This is the unintended revelation of an event from Heike's glory days.'"
20,1,誰漏しつらん。,Who could have leaked this?
20,2,定て北面の者共が中にこそ有らむなど、思はじ事なう案じ續けて坐けるに、後の方より足音の高らかにしければ、すは唯今我命を失はむとて、武士共が参るにこそと待給に、入道自ら板敷高らかに踏鳴し、大納言の坐ける後の障子を、さとあけられたり。,"Even if the Northern Guards were inside, he sat perplexed when loud footsteps came from behind. 'Surely they come to take my life now!' He himself stamped heavily on the floorboards and violently tore open the sliding door behind where the Grand Councilor sat."
20,3,素絹の衣の、短らかなるに、白き大口ふみくゝみ、聖柄の刀押くつろげてさす儘に、以の外に怒れる気色にて、大納言を暫睨まへ、「抑御邊は平治にも已に誅せらるべかりしを、内府が身にかへて申宥、頸を繼たてましは如何に。何の遺恨を以て、此一門ほろぼすべき由御結構は候けるやらん。恩を知を人とはいふぞ、恩を知ぬをば畜生とこそいへ。されども當家の運命盡ざるに依て、迎へたてまつたり。日比の御結構の次第、直に承らん。」とぞ宣ける。,"Clad in a white silk robe, his sleeves rolled up to reveal powerful arms, he brandished the sacred sword and glared at the Grand Councilor: 'Though your family was slated for execution even in Heiji times, Lord Regent spared them. Yet now you demand our heads! What enmity justifies destroying this entire clan? Those who know gratitude are called men; those who do not are beasts. But since our fate is sealed... I beg to hear of your intentions.'"
20,4,大納言「全くさること候はず。人の讒言にてぞ候らむ。能々御尋候へ。」と申されければ、入,"The Grand Councilor replied, 'This is utterly false! It's all slander. I shall respectfully clarify the matter...' Then entered..."
20,5,道言せも果ず。,Priest Dōgen could not speak.
20,6,「人やある、人やある。」と召れければ、貞能参りたり。,"'There's someone here! Someone here!' called out, and Lord Sadamune appeared."
20,7,「西光めが白状參せよ。」と仰られければ、持て参りたり。,"Ordered to 'Bring West Light for testimony,' he was brought forth."
20,8,是を取て二三返押返々々讀きかせ、「あなにくや、此上は何と陳ずべき。」とて、大納言の顏にさと投懸け、障子をちやうとたててぞ出られける。,"After forcing him to recite the charges three times, 'Wretched man! What words can justify this?' he hurled accusations at the Grand Councilor's face and exited, slamming the door."
20,9,入道猶腹を居兼て、「経遠、兼康」と召せば、瀬尾太郎、難波次郎、参りたり。,"Still seething inside, he called out 'Kyōen! Kan'kon!' whereupon Saeo Maro and Naniwa Jirō entered."
20,10,「あの男取て、庭へ引落せ。」と宣へば、是等は左右なうもし奉らず、「小松殿の御氣色いかゞ候はんずらん。」と申すれば、入道相國大にいかて、「よし／＼、己らは内府が命をば重して、入道が仰をば輕うじけるごさんなれ。その上は力及ばず。」と宣へば、此事あしかりなんとや思けん、二人の者共立上て、大納言を庭へ引落し奉る。,"Ordered to 'Take that man and drag him outside,' they hesitated: 'How can we act against Lord Kozukeyama's will?' The Regent roared, 'Enough! We revere the Inner Court's orders more than yours. Moreover, our strength is limited!' Reluctantly, both men hauled the Grand Councilor into the courtyard."
20,11,其時入道心地よげにて、「取て伏せて、喚かせよ。」とぞ宣ける。,"Then with a sinister smile, he commanded: 'Knock him down and make him scream!'"
20,12,二人の者ども、大納言の左右の耳に口をあて、「如何様にも御聲の出べう候。」と私語いて引伏奉れば、二聲三聲ぞ喚れける。,"Placing their mouths to the Grand Councilor's ears, they whispered 'Make a noise!' and forced him to scream twice, thrice..."
20,13,其體、冥途にて娑婆世界の罪人を、或は業の秤にかけ、或は淨頗梨鏡に引向て、罪の輕重に任せつつ、阿防羅刹が呵責すらんも、是には過じとぞ見えし。,"This spectacle outshone even Hell's punishments - weighing sinners on karma scales, reflecting them in purgatorial mirrors, while demons berated them. Yet here was surpassing cruelty."
20,14,蕭樊囚れ囚て韓彭俎醢たり。,Like Xiao Han imprisoned and Han Peng minced into mincemeat...
20,15,晁錯戮をうけて周儀罪せらる。,"Chao Cuo executed, Zhou Yi punished..."
20,16,たとへば、蕭何、樊、韓信、彭越、是等は皆高祖の忠臣なりしか共、小人の讒に依て、過敗の恥をうくとも、か様の事をや申べき。,"Even though Xiao He, Han Xin, Peng Yue were all loyal subjects to the First Emperor - wronged by courtiers' slander, disgraced in death... How could such injustices be endured?"
20,17,新大納言は我身のかくなるにつけても、子息丹波の少將成経以下、をさなき人々如何なる目にか遭らむと、おもひやるにもおぼつかなし。,"The new Grand Councilor lamented: 'Even if I perish, what fate awaits my son Danba Shogun Narimasa and other dependents? It is beyond comprehension.'"
20,18,さばかり熱き六月に裝束だにもくつろげず、熱さもたへがたければ、,"In sweltering June, refusing to remove his formal attire despite the unbearable heat..."
20,19,胸せき上る心地して、汗も涙も争ひてぞ流れける。,"His chest heaving, sweat and tears mingled in rivulets."
20,20,「さり共小松殿は、,"Indeed, Lord Kozukeyama..."
20,21,思召はなたじ者を。,a man of profound thought...
20,22,」とのたまへ共、誰して申べしと覺給はず。,"Though praised thus, none dared respond."
21,0,丹波少將成經は、其夜しも院の御所法住寺殿に上臥して、未出られざりけるに、大納言の侍共、急ぎ御所へ馳參て、少將殿を呼出し奉り、此由申に、「などや宰相の許より今まで告知せざるらん。」と、宣も果ねば、宰相殿よりとて使あり。,"Danba Shogun Narimori, having stayed at the Imperial Court's Hozo-ji Hall that night without departing, was urgently summoned by the attendants of Dainagon. They called out to him, saying, 'Why has there been no notification from the Minister's residence until now?' After delivering this message, a messenger arrived from the Minister."
21,1,此宰相と申は、入道相國の弟也、宿所は六波羅の惣門の内なれば門脇の宰相とぞ申ける。,"This Minister is the younger brother of the Retired Regent (Inudou Sokuo). His residence being within the main gate of Rokuhara, he was known as 'Monzeki Sessho.'"
21,2,丹波少將には舅なり。,He is the maternal uncle of Danba Shogun Narimori.
21,3,「何事にて候やらん、入道相國のきと西八條へ具し奉れと候と申せ。」といはせられたりければ、少將此事心得て、近習の女房達呼出し奉り、「夜邊何となう世の物騒う候しを、例の山法師の下るかと餘所に思て候へば、早成経が身の上にて候ひけり。大納言よさり斬らるべう候なれば、成経も同罪にてこそ候はんずらめ。今一度御所へ參て、君をも見まゐらせたう候へ共、既にかゝる身に罷成て候へば、憚存候。」とぞ申されける。,"When ordered, 'What business brings the Retired Regent to West Hachijo?' Shogun Narimori summoned his attendants and lamented: 'These turbulent times—could it be that the Mountain Monk (a reference to Taira no Kiyomori) is descending? Though my health fails, if Dainagon is to be executed, I too shall share guilt. Yet I must return to court to bid farewell to His Majesty.'"
21,4,女房達御前へ參り、此由奏せられければ、法皇大に驚かせ給て、さればこそ今朝の入道相國が使に早御心得あり。,"When the attendants reported this to the Retired Emperor, He was greatly alarmed—hence the urgent envoy from the Retired Regent that morning."
21,5,「あは此等が内々謀し事の漏にけるよ。」と思召すにあさまし。,"'Alas, this secret scheme has been exposed!' The Retired Emperor lamented deeply."
21,6,「さるにても是へ。」と御氣色有ければ、參られたり。,"With a grave expression, the Retired Regent proceeded."
21,7,法皇も御,The Retired Emperor
21,8,涙を流させ給ひて、仰下さるゝ旨もなし。,wept silently without uttering a word.
21,9,少將も涙に咽で申あぐる旨もなし。,"Shogun Narimori swallowed his tears, unable to speak."
21,10,良有てさてもあるべきならねば少將袖を顏に押當てゝ、泣々罷出られけり。,"The Retired Regent pressed his sleeve to Narimori's face, weeping as he departed."
21,11,法皇は後を遙に御覽じ送らせ給ひて、末代こそ心憂けれ、是かぎりで又御覽ぜぬ事もやあらんずらんとて、御涙を流させ給ぞ忝き。,"The Retired Emperor watched him leave with a heavy heart, lamenting that future generations would inherit this sorrow. 'How could I not weep?' he murmured."
21,12,院中の人々、少將の袖をひかへ、袂にすがて名殘ををしみ、涙を流さぬはなかりけり。,"Courtiers clung to Narimori's sleeves, their tears dampening his hem as they mourned."
21,13,舅の宰相の許へ出られたれば、北方は近う産すべき人にて御座けるが、今朝より此歎を打添て、已に命も消入る心地ぞせられける。,"At his uncle's residence, the Minister (now gravely ill) lamented: 'With delivery imminent and this sorrow added to it, my life is surely fading.'"
21,14,少將御所を罷出つるより、流るゝ涙つきせぬに、北方の有様を見給ひてはいとゞ爲方なげにぞ見えられける。,"As Narimori left the palace, his tears unseen, he pitied the Minister's dire state."
21,15,少將乳母に六條と云女房あり。,Narimori's nursemaid Rokujo
21,16,「御乳に参り始候らひて、君をちの中より抱上参て、月日の重なるに隨ひて、我身の年の行をば歎ずして、君の成人しう成せ給ふ事をのみうれしう思ひ奉り、白地とは思へども、既に二十一年、片時も離れ参らせず。院内へ参らせ給ひて、遅う出させ給ふだにも、覺束なう思ひ参らするに、如何なる御目にか遭せ給はんずらん。」と泣く。,"cried, 'I've served you since infancy, never leaving your side for twenty-one years. Though I thought my duty complete, how could I face His Majesty's gaze now?'"
21,17,少將、「痛な歎そ。宰相さて坐れば、命許はさり共乞請給はんずらん。」と、慰たまへども、人目もしらず、泣悶えけり。,"Narimori consoled her, 'Alas, my uncle's plight moves me. Yet even if he survives, we must beg for mercy.' But in private, both wept silently."
21,18,西八條殿より、使しきなみに有ければ、宰相「行むかうてこそ、ともかうも成め。」とて出給へば少將も宰相の車の後に乘てぞ出られける。,"When messengers arrived from West Hachijo, the Minister declared, 'We must go,' and both he and Narimori followed in his carriage."
21,19,保元平治より以來、平家の人々、樂榮えのみ有て、愁歎はなかりしに、此宰相計こそ、由なき聟ゆゑに、かゝる歎をばせられけれ。,"Since the Hogen and Heiji Disturbances, the Taira had known only prosperity, knowing no sorrow—yet this minister's scheme was a lament born of an unnatural alliance."
21,20,西八條近うなて、車を停め、先案内を申入られければ、太政入道「丹波少將をば此内へは入らるべから,"Approaching West Hachijo, the carriage halted. The Chancellor declared, 'Danba Shogun shall not enter this compound'"
21,21,ず。,.
21,22,」と宣ふ間、其邊近き侍の家におろし置つゝ、宰相計ぞ門の内へは入給ふ。,while the Minister was escorted inside.
21,23,少將をば、いつしか兵共打圍んで守護し奉る。,Narimori's party was immediately surrounded by guards.
21,24,憑れつる宰相殿には離れ給ひぬ。,"The Minister, however, remained unharmed."
21,25,少將の心の中、さこそは便無りけめ。,Narimori's heart was heavy with dread.
21,26,宰相中門に居給ひたければ、入道対面もし給はず。,"Though the Minister resided within the inner gate, he never met the Retired Regent."
21,27,源大夫判官季貞をもて申入られけるは、「由なき者に親うなて、返々悔しう候へども、甲斐も候はず。相具せさせて候者の、此程惱む事の候なるが、今朝より此歎を打そへては既に命も絶なんず。何かはくるしう候べき。少將をば暫く教盛に預させおはしませ。教盛かうて候へば、なじかは僻事せさせ候べき。」と申されければ、季貞参て此由申す。,"Koremori Taira (the 'Teach-me' Lord) was summoned: 'Though we regret aiding this man, his anguish since dawn has doomed him. Place Shogun Narimori under guard with Koremori temporarily.'"
21,28,「あはれ例の宰相が、物に心得ぬ。」とて、頓に返事もし給はず。,"The Minister lamented, 'Alas, the Retired Regent misunderstands,' and delayed responding."
21,29,良有て入道宣けるは、「新大納言成親、此一門を滅して天下を亂むとする企あり。此少將は既に彼大納言が嫡子也。疎うもあれ、親うもあれ、えこそ申宥むまじけれ。若此謀反とげましかば、御邊とてもおだしうや御座べきと申せ。」とこそのたまひけれ。,"The Retired Regent declared: 'New Dainagon Naritomo plots to overthrow the realm. Though this Shogun is his heir, regardless of affection or estrangement, he must be purged.'"
21,30,季貞歸参て、此由宰相殿に申すれば、誠に本意なげにて、重て申されけるは、「保元平治より以降、度々の合戰にも、御命に代り参らせんとこそ存候へ。此後もあらき風をば、先防ぎ参らせ候はんずるに、縱教盛こそ年老て候とも、若き子供數多候へば、一方の御固にはなどか成で候べき。それに成経暫預らうと申を、御容れ無きは、教盛を一向二心ある者と思召にこそ。是程後めたう思はれ参らせては、世に有ても何にかはし候べき。今は只身の暇を賜て、出家入道し、片山里に籠て、一筋に後世菩提の勤を營み候はん。由なき憂世の交なり。世にあればこそ望もあれ、望の叶はねばこそ恨もあれ。しかじ忧世を厭ひ、眞の道に入なんには。」とぞ宣,"Koremori relayed this, whereupon the Minister, breaking down: 'Since Hogen and Heiji, I served as your shield. Now, if you refuse to protect Narimori, let me retire to a mountain hermitage—this world's sorrows are too great.'"
21,31,ける。,.
21,32,季貞参て、「宰相殿は早思召切て候ぞ。ともかうも能樣に御計ひ候へ。」と申ければ、入道、大に驚いて、「さればとて出家入道まではあまりにけしからず。其儀ならば、少將をば暫御邊に預奉ると云べし。」とこそ宣けれ。,"Koremori urged, 'Hurry your decision.' The Retired Regent, shocked: 'Retirement is excessive. Simply detain Shogun Narimori temporarily.'"
21,33,季貞歸まゐて、宰相殿に此由申せば、「あはれ人の子をば持まじかりける物かな。我子の縁に結れざらむには、是程心をば碎じ物を。」とて出られけり。,"Upon learning this, the Minister wept: 'How cruel! To sever my son's fate from mine—my heart is broken.'"
21,34,少將待受奉て、「さていかゞ候つる、」と申されければ、「入道餘に腹をたてて、教盛には終に對面もし給はず。叶ふまじき由頻に宣ひつれ共、出家入道まで申たればにやらん、暫く宿所に置奉れとの給ひつれども、始終よかるべしとも覺えず。」少將、「さ候へばこそ成経も御恩をもて、暫の命も延候はんずるにこそ。其につき候ては、大納言が事をばいかゞ聞召され候ぞ。」「其迄は思も寄ず。」と宣へば、其時涙をはら／＼と流いて、「誠に御恩を以てしばしの命もいき候はんずる事は然るべう候へども、命の惜う候も、父を今一度見ばやと思ふ爲也。大納言が斬れ候はんに於ては、成経とても、かひなき命を生て何にかはし候べき。唯一所でいかにもなる樣に、申てたばせ給ふべうや候らん。」と申されければ、宰相世にも苦げにて、「いさとよ、御邊の事をこそとかう申つれ。其までは思も寄ねども、大納言殿の御事をば、今朝内の大臣の樣々に申されければ、其も暫は心安い樣にこそ承はれ。」と宣へば、少將、泣々手を合てぞ悦れける。,"Narimori, awaiting judgment, pleaded: 'If only I could see my father one last time... Should Dainagon be executed, what purpose remains for me?' The Minister relented: 'Advise His Majesty to spare you temporarily.' With tears, Narimori knelt in gratitude."
21,35,「子ならざらむ者は、誰か唯今我身の上をさしおいて、是程までは悦べき。實の契は親子の中にぞ有ける。子をば人の持べかりける物哉。」とやがて思ぞ返されける。,The Minister realized: 'To cherish one's child is the true bond. How could I ever treat him as another's?'
21,36,さて今朝,"Thus, that morning,"
21,37,の如くに同車して歸られけり。,both returned to court in the same carriage.
21,38,宿所には女房達、死だる人の生かへりたる心地して、差つどひて皆悦び泣どもせられけり。,"At their lodging, attendants wept with joy, as if reviving the dead."
22,0,太政入道は、か様に人々數多縛め置ても、猶心行ずや思はれけん。,"Though the Retired Regent has bound countless people, it is thought that his heart still does not move."
22,1,既に赤地の錦の直垂に、黒絲縅の腹卷の、白金物打たる胸板せめて、先年安藝守たりし時、神拜の次に、靈夢を蒙て、嚴島の大明神より現に賜はられたりける銀の蛭巻したる小長刀、常の枕を放ず立されたりしを脇挾み、中門の廊へぞ出られける。,"Already attired in a crimson brocade straight-gown, black-silk lined cuirass with a chestplate beaten in white metal, he carried at his side the silver short sword coiled like leeches – a gift from the Great Deity of Itsukushima received in a divine dream after worshiping there as Lord of Aki Province years before. He had left his customary pillow and stood in the middle gate corridor."
22,2,其気色大方ゆゝしうぞ見えし。,His demeanor appeared most imposing.
22,3,貞能を召す。,They summoned Tadanao
22,4,[2]筑後守貞能は木蘭地の直垂に緋縅の鎧著て、御前に畏て候。,"(2) Lord Tadanao of Chikugo Province, clad in a木兰-patterned straight-gown and crimson-silk armor, stood respectfully before his superior."
22,5,やゝあて入道宣けるは、「貞能、此事如何思ふ。,"The Retired Regent then said: 'Tadanao, what is your opinion on this matter?"
22,6,保元に平右馬助を始として、一門半過て、新院の御方へ参にき。,"Starting with Lord Hira no Umajō in the 保元 era, more than half of our clan paid court visits to the Retired Emperor's new palace."
22,7,一宮の御事は、故刑部卿殿の養君にて坐いしかば、旁々見放ち参らせ難かしども、故院の御遺誡に任て、御方にて先を懸たりき。,"Regarding the succession to the Crown Prince: Though it was difficult to appoint an adopted son of the late Minister of Justice, we obeyed the late Emperor's final wish and entrusted you with precedence."
22,8,是一の奉公也。,This was our loyal service.
22,9,次に平治元年十二月、信頼義朝が院内を取奉り、大内にたて籠り天下黒闇と成しに、入道身を捨て、凶徒を追落し、経宗惟方を召縛しに至まで、既に君の御爲に命を失んとする事度度に及ぶ。,"Then in the twelfth month of the 平治 era, when Yoshitomo Minamoto seized the palace, barricaded himself in the capital causing chaos, we abandoned our lives to rout the rebels and imprison Kakushin Ichi no Tō until repeatedly risking death for your sake."
22,10,たとひ人何と申す共、七代までは此一門をば爭でか捨させ給べき。,"Though people may say otherwise, we should have willingly sacrificed this entire clan for seven generations."
22,11,其中に成親と云ふ無用の徒者、西光と云下賤の不當人めが申す事に附かせ給て、此一門を滅すべき由、法皇の御結構こそ遺恨の次第なれ。,"But due to the baseless schemes of that useless fool 成親 and contemptible upstart 西光, we were driven to destroy our own clan – truly a lamentable outcome stemming from the Cloistered Emperor's final instructions."
22,12,此後も讒奏する者あらば、當家追討の院宣下されつと覺るぞ。,"Should any further slander arise, we expect an imperial decree ordering our destruction."
22,13,朝敵となて後は、いかに悔ゆとも益あるまじ。,"Once declared enemies of the court, no amount of remorse can avail us now."
22,14,世を靜めん程、,"To restore peace to the realm,"
22,15,法皇を鳥羽の北殿へ移奉るか、然らずは、是へまれ、御幸をなし参らせんと思ふは如何に。,"should we either relocate the Cloistered Emperor to the Northern Hall of 鳥羽 or arrange for his imperial visit here, what do you think?"
22,16,其儀ならば、北面の輩、箭をも一つ射んずらん。,"If this were done, even the palace guards would hesitate to draw a single arrow."
22,17,侍共にその用意せよと觸べし。,The samurai were instructed to prepare accordingly.
22,18,大方は入道院方の奉公思切たり。,All officials showed great devotion in serving the Retired Regent's court.
22,19,馬に鞍おかせよ。,Saddle the horses!
22,20,きせながとり出せ。,Bring out the armor!
22,21,」とぞ宣ける。,the Retired Regent commanded.
22,22,主馬判官盛國、急ぎ小松殿へ馳參て、「世は既にかう候。」と申すれば、大臣聞も敢ず。,"When Stablemaster Morikuni rushed to the Small Pine Palace shouting, 'The world has already turned,' the minister dared not respond."
22,23,「あは早成親卿が首を刎られたるな。」と宣へば、「さは候はねども、入道殿御著背長召され候。侍共も皆打立て法住寺殿へ寄んと出て候。法皇をば鳥羽殿へ押籠参らせうと候が、内々は鎮西の方へ流し参らせうと被擬候。」と申せば、大臣、爭かさる事在べきと思へ共、今朝の禪門の氣色、さる物狂しき事もあるらむとて、車を飛して、西八條へぞおはしたる。,"""Quick! 成親's head has been cut off!"" When told this, the minister replied: ""Though so, the Retired Regent has ordered a long-sleeved robe. All retainers are mobilizing to attack 法住寺. We plan to confine the Cloistered Emperor in 鳥羽 Palace but secretly exile him westward."" Though the minister thought action was needed, seeing the abnormal atmosphere at the Zen gate that morning, he raced his carriage to Nishi-Yatoi."
22,24,門前にて車よりおり、門の内へ指入て見給へば、入道腹卷を著給ふ上は一門の卿相雲客數十人、各色々の直垂に、思々の鎧著て、中門の廊に二行に著座せられたり。,"Alighting from his carriage at the gate and peering inside, he saw: Wearing armor over his cuirass, the Retired Regent presided over dozens of courtiers – daimyōs and retainers clad in various colored straight-gowns and matching armors, seated in two rows along the middle gate corridor."
22,25,其外諸国の受領衞府諸司などは、縁に居溢れ、庭にもひしと竝居たり。,"Outside, provincial governors and court officials crowded the verandas and filled the courtyard."
22,26,旗竿共引そばめ／＼、馬の腹帶を固め、甲の緒を縮め、唯今皆打立んずる気色共なるに、小松殿烏帽子直衣の大文の指貫のそば取て、さやめき入給へば、事の外にぞ見えられける。,"While flagpoles were raised, girths tightened, and armor laces drawn tight – all preparing to fight – a young page from the Small Pine Palace approached in court robes and intricate sash cords. His appearance stood out remarkably."
22,27,入道ふし目に成て、あはれ例の内府が、世をへうする樣に振舞、大に諫ばやとこそ思はれけめども、さすが子ながらも、内には五戒を保て慈悲を先とし、外には五常を亂らず、禮儀を正しうし給ふ人なれば、あの姿に腹卷を著て向はむ事、面はゆう辱しうや思はれけん、障子を少し引立て、素絹の衣を腹卷の上に、周章著に著給たりけるが、胸板の金物の少しはづれ,"Though the Retired Regent's expression darkened, recalling how his usual calm demeanor now seemed frantic, he wanted to remonstrate. Yet as a father must, he maintained inner discipline (upholding the Five Precepts and prioritizing compassion) and outer propriety (not disrupting the Five Virtues or proper etiquette). Seeing him wear armor over this attire felt disgraceful. He slightly pulled back the shōji screen, layered silk robes over his cuirass awkwardly..."
22,28,て見えけるを藏さうと、頻に衣の胸を引ちがへ引ちがへぞし給ひける。,"Trying to hide the exposed metal fittings, he repeatedly tugged at his robes."
22,29,大臣は舎弟宗盛卿の座上につき給ふ。,The minister stood beside his younger brother Munemori's seat.
22,30,入道も宣ひ出さず、大臣も申しいださるゝ事もなし。,Neither the Retired Regent spoke nor did the minister respond.
22,31,良有て入道のたまひけるは、「成親卿が謀反は事の數にもあらず。一向法皇の御結構にて在るぞや。世をしづめん程、法皇を鳥羽の北殿へ遷奉るか、然らずば、是へまれ、御幸を成まゐらせんと思ふは如何に。」と宣へば、大臣聞も敢ず、はら／＼とぞ泣れける。,"Finally, the Retired Regent spoke: ""The rebellion of Lord 成親 exceeds ordinary offenses. It stems from the Cloistered Emperor's orders. To restore peace, should we relocate him to the Northern Hall or arrange an imperial visit here?"" The minister, unable to answer, wept bitterly."
22,32,入道、「如何に／＼。」とあきれ給ふ。,"""Then what should we do?"" the Retired Regent asked in confusion."
22,33,大臣涙を抑て申されけるは、「此仰承候に、御運は早末に成ぬと覺候。,"The minister, controlling his tears: ""As you command, we must act before misfortune strikes."
22,34,人の運命の傾んとては、必惡事を思立候也。,"For when fate turns, one inevitably resorts to evil deeds."
22,35,又御有樣、更現共覺候はず。,"Moreover, your majesty's situation cannot remain unchanged."
22,36,さすが我朝は邊地粟散の境と申ながら、天照大神の御子孫、國の主として、天兒屋根命の末、朝の政を司どり給ひしより以降、太政大臣の官に至る人の、甲冑をよろふ事禮儀を背にあらずや。,"Yet our dynasty, though claiming descent from 天照大神 through 天児屋根命 who governed since ancient times, has always held that wearing armor dishonors court protocol."
22,37,就中に御出家の御身なり。,Especially for a sovereign who has taken monastic vows.
22,38,夫三世の諸佛解脱幢相の法衣を脱捨て、忽に甲冑を鎧ひ、弓箭を帶しましまさむ事、内には既に破戒無慙の罪を招くのみならず、外には又仁義禮智信の法にも背き候なんず。,"To discard the saffron robes of Buddhist liberation and don armor, carry bows – this not only violates monastic precepts shamelessly but also contravenes the Five Virtues (Benevolence, Righteousness, Propriety, Wisdom, Faith)."
22,39,旁々恐ある申事にて候へども、心の底に旨趣を殘すべきに非ず。,"Though many dangers loom, we cannot abandon our principles."
22,40,先世に四恩あり。,Our ancestors taught the Four Graces:
22,41,天地の恩、國王の恩、父母の恩、衆生の恩是也。,"Heaven and Earth, the sovereign, parents, and all living beings."
22,42,其中に最重きは朝恩也。,"Of these, royal favor is most sacred."
22,43,普天の下王地に非ずと云ふ事なし。,No land exists beyond the emperor's domain.
22,44,さればかの頴川の水に耳を洗ひ、首陽山に蕨を折し賢人も、勅命背き難き禮儀をば存知すとこそ承はれ。,Thus even sages who drank 頴川 water or gathered ferns on 首陽山 knew imperial decrees must be obeyed.
22,45,何に況、先祖にも未聞ざし太政大臣を極めさせ給ふ。,"How much more so for us, who have never seen such a Retired Regent?"
22,46,所謂重盛が無才愚闇の身をもて、蓮府槐門の位に至る。,"Though 重盛, despite his incompetence and darkness, attained the highest rank"
22,47,加之國郡半過て一門の所領と成、田園悉く一家の進止たり。,"and our clan gained half the provinces as fiefs, with all fields controlled by our house..."
22,48,是希代の朝恩に非ずや。,This was unprecedented royal favor.
22,49,今是等の莫大の御恩を思召忘れて、猥しく法皇,Now to forget this immense grace and...
22,50,を傾け参らせ給はん事、天照大神、正八幡宮の神慮にも背き候ひなんず。,...overthrow the Cloistered Emperor would violate the deities' will.
22,51,日本は是神國也。,Japan is a divine realm.
22,52,神は非禮を受給はず。,The gods reject impiety.
22,53,然れば君の思召立ところ、道理半無に非ず。,Thus your plan lacks all reason.
22,54,中にも此一門は、代々の朝敵を平げて、四海の逆浪を靜る事は無雙の忠なれ共、其賞に誇る事は傍若無人共申つべし。,"Though our clan has crushed countless court enemies and calmed the nation's rebellions with unparalleled loyalty, we dare not boast of such rewards."
22,55,聖徳太子十七箇條の御憲法に『人皆心有り、必各執あり、彼を是し我を非し、我を是し彼を非す。,"As Prince Shōtoku's Seventeen-Article Constitution states: 'All people have hearts, each clinging to their own perspective – regarding others' faults as virtues and their own virtues as faults'"
22,56,是非の理誰か能く定べき。,Who can truly judge right from wrong?
22,57,相共に賢愚なり。,Both sages and fools exist.
22,58,環の如くして端なし。,Like a circle without beginning or end
22,59,爰を以て縱人怒ると云とも、かへて我咎を懼れよ。,"Thus even if others' anger must be endured, let us fear our own faults."
22,60,』とこそ見えて候へ。,as written in the constitution.
22,61,然れ共御運盡ざるに依て、御謀反已に露ぬ。,"However, your majesty's downfall is now inevitable."
22,62,其上仰合せらるゝ成親卿を召置れぬる上は、縱君如何なる不思議を思召し立せ給ふとも、何の恐か候べき。,"Especially since we cannot arrest Lord 成親. Even if you devise any extraordinary measures, what fear could they inspire?"
22,63,所當の罪科行れん上は、退いて事の由を陳じ申させ給て、君の御爲には彌奉公の忠勤を盡し、民の爲には益撫育の哀憐を致させ給はば、神明の加護に預り佛陀の冥慮に背べからず。,"Instead, we should: 1) Admit guilt where appropriate 2) Explain our position humbly 3) Dedicate ourselves to your service with renewed devotion 4) Show compassion for the people. This would earn divine protection without violating Buddhist teachings."
22,64,神明佛陀感應あらば、君も思召なほす事などか候はざるべき。,"Should deities and Buddhas respond, even your most stubborn desires would be granted."
22,65,君と臣とを比るに親疎別く方なし。,There exists no distinction between sovereign and subject
22,66,道理と僻事を竝べんに、爭か道理に附ざるべき。,"When balancing principle with circumstances, one must always side with right."
22,67,"[2] Nihon Koten Bungaku Taikei (Tokyo: Iwanami Shoten, 1957, vol. 32; hereafter cited as NKBT) reads 筑後守貞能、木蘭地の直垂に.","(2) Nihon Koten Bungaku Taikei (Iwanami Shoten, 1957, vol. 32) reads: ""Chikugo no kami Tadanao in a木兰-patterned straight-gown..."""
23,0,是は君の御理にて候へば、叶はざらむまでも院御所法住寺殿を守護し参らせ候べし。,"If it be according to the Lord’s will, even if there were obstacles, we shall guard the Imperial Palace and the temples of Rokujo-in."
23,1,其故は重盛叙爵より今大臣の大將に至迄、併ら君の御恩ならずと云ふ事なし。,"The reason being that from being granted a title by Shigemori to becoming the Grand General of the present Minister, there is none who would say he does not owe you gratitude."
23,2,其恩の重き事を思へば、千顆萬顆の玉にも越え、其恩の深き色を案ずれば、一入再入の紅にも過たらん。,"When considering the weight of this favor, it surpasses even countless pearls. When pondering its depth, it exceeds the richest crimson dye."
23,3,然れば院中に参り籠り候べし。,Thus we shall enter the Retired Emperor’s palace and remain there in seclusion.
23,4,其儀にて候はば、重盛が身に代り、命に代らんと契りたる侍共、少,"In such a case, the retainers who have pledged to substitute their lives for Shigemori’s—though few in number—"
23,5,少候らん。,shall surely await.
23,6,是等を召具して、院の御所法住寺殿を守護しまゐらせ候はば、さすが以の外の御大事でこそ候はんずらめ。,To gather these few and have them guard the Imperial Palace and Rokujo-in would indeed be a matter of utmost importance.
23,7,悲哉、君の御爲に奉公の忠を致んとすれば、迷盧八萬の頂より猶高き父の恩忽に忘れんとす。,"Alas! To serve you with loyalty, one might forget even the profound debt of gratitude to one’s father—a debt higher than the peaks of the eight thousand mountains."
23,8,痛哉、不孝の罪を遁れんとすれば、君の御爲に已に不忠の逆臣と成ぬべし。,"Woe! To flee the sin of filial ingratitude, one would become a traitor to you—a disloyal minister."
23,9,進退惟谷れり。,I am caught between a rock and a hard place.
23,10,是非いかにも辨へ難し。,Right and wrong are truly difficult to discern.
23,11,申請る所詮は、唯重盛が頸を召され候へ。,My sole request is that Shigemori’s head be taken.
23,12,院中をも守護し参らすべからず。,We must not guard the Retired Emperor’s palace.
23,13,院参の御供をも仕るべからず。,Nor may we attend upon his presence at court.
23,14,かの蕭何は大功かたへに越たるに依て、官大相國に至り、劔を帯し沓を履ながら殿上に昇る事を許されしか共、叡慮に背く事あれば、高祖重う警て、深う罪せられにき。,"Even Xiao He, who rose to Grand Minister due to great merits and was permitted to wear sword and sandals in the palace, was severely punished when he defied the Emperor Gaozu’s wisdom."
23,15,か様の先蹤を思ふにも、富貴と云ひ、榮花と云ひ、朝恩と云ひ、重職と云ひ、旁極させ給ぬれば、御運の盡ん事難かるべきに非ず。,"Reflecting on such precedents, if one does not fully exhaust the Lord’s grace—whether through wealth, honor, imperial favor, or high office—the end of his fortune will surely come."
23,16,何迄か命生て、亂れん世をも見候べき。,At least let us live to see a time when the world is not in chaos.
23,17,唯末代に生を受けて、かゝる憂目に逢候重盛が果報の程こそ拙う候へ。,"Alas, for Shigemori to be born in this age and meet such a calamity—his retribution is indeed pitiable."
23,18,只今侍一人に仰附て、御坪の内に引出されて、重盛が首の刎られん事は、易い程の事でこそ候へ。,"Now, with a single retainer ordered to assist, Shigemori’s head will be severed within the courtyard—a matter as simple as it sounds."
23,19,是おの／＼聞給へ。,Hear this truth.
23,20,」とて直衣の袖も絞る許に涙を流し、かき口説かれければ、一門の人々、心あるも心なきも皆袖をぞ濕れける。,"Thus spoke the speaker, weeping so profusely that his sleeves were soaked. Persuaded by his words, all members of the family—whether earnest or indifferent—wiped tears from their sleeves."
23,21,太政入道も、頼切たる内府はか様に宣ふ。,Even the Minister of State and the trustworthy Naifu spoke in this manner.
23,22,力もなげにて、「いや／＼是迄は思も寄さうず。惡黨共が申す事につかせ給ひて、僻事などや出こむずらんと思ふ計でこそ候へ。」とのたまへば、大臣、「縱如何なる僻事出來候とも、君をば何とかし参らせ給ふべき。」とて、つい立て中門に出で侍共に仰られけるは、「唯今重盛が申しつる事をば、汝等承ずや。<sentence>,"The speaker, overwhelmed with emotion, cried, “No! This is beyond comprehension. We must comply with the evil counselors’ demands to prevent worse from happening.” To this, the minister replied, “Regardless of what transpires, you must find a way to serve the Lord.” He then exited through the middle gate and addressed his retainers: “Do you understand Shigemori’s words now?”"
23,23,今朝より是に候う,"Since this morning, we have been awaiting—"
23,24,てか様の事共申靜むと存じつれ共、餘にひた噪に見えつる間、歸りたりつる也。,"Though we believed these matters would be settled, amid the clamor of chaos, I have returned."
23,25,院参の御供に於ては、重盛が頸の召されむを見て仕れ。,"At the Retired Emperor’s court, serve as attendants until Shigemori’s head is taken."
23,26,さらば人参れ。,Then enter the palace.
23,27,」とて、小松殿へぞ歸られける。,"With these words, they returned to Komatsu-dono [Shigemori’s residence]."
23,28,主馬判官盛國を召て、「重盛こそ天下の大事を別して聞出したれ。我を我と思はん者共は、皆物具して馳参れと披露せよ。」と宣へば、此由披露す。,"The Minister summoned Masunori, the Stable Master, and declared: “Shigemori must address the nation’s affairs. All who believe in themselves should prepare arms and hasten to his aid.” This was announced."
23,29,「朧げにては噪がせ給はぬ人の、かゝる披露の有は別の仔細のあるにこそ。」と、皆物具して我も／＼と馳参る。,"“Those who cannot act decisively in times of confusion, this unusual mobilization has its own purpose,” they said. Thus all prepared arms and rushed to join—myself included."
23,30,淀、羽束師、宇治、岡屋、日野、勸修寺、醍醐、小栗栖、梅津、桂、大原、靜原、芹生の里に溢居たる兵共或は鎧著て、未甲を著ぬもあり、或は矢負て未弓を持たぬもあり。,"From Omiya, Hachimaki, Uji, Okaya, Hino, Kōmyō-ji, Daigo, Ogurisue, Umegawa, Katsura, Ōhara, Seihara, and Seriguchi—soldiers from these regions poured forth. Some wore armor but lacked helmets; others carried arrows without bows."
23,31,片鐙蹈や蹈まずにて、周章噪いで馳参る。,"Clad in half-armor or none, they clamored and raced about in confusion."
23,32,小松殿に噪ぐ事ありと聞えしかば、西八條に數千騎ありける兵共、入道にかうとも申も入ず、さざめき連て、皆小松殿へぞ馳たりける。,"When news reached them that Komatsu-dono was in turmoil, thousands of mounted warriors from Nishiyamato—refusing to heed the priest’s warnings—rushed there in a frenzy."
23,33,少しも弓箭に携る程の者は一人も殘ず。,Not a single archer remained.
23,34,其時入道大に驚き、貞能を召て、「内府は何と思ひて、是等をば呼とるやらん。是で言つる様に、入道が許へ討手などや向んずらん。」と宣へば、貞能涙をはら／＼と流いて「人も人にこそ依せ給ひ候へ。爭かさる御事候べき。これにて申させ給ひつる事共も、皆御後悔ぞ候らん。」と申ければ、入道、内府に中違うては、惡かりなんとや思はれけん。,"The priest was astounded and summoned贞能 (Tadane), exclaiming, “What madness drives the Naifu to summon these men? Will they not attack us as you suggest?” Tadane wept bitterly: “We act only as humans must. Let there be no conflict. All our actions will surely bring regret.” The priest, realizing his error in siding with the Naifu, lamented deeply."
23,35,法皇仰参らせん事も、はや思とゞまり、腹卷脱おき、素絹の衣に袈裟打掛て、最心にも起らぬ念誦してこそ坐しけれ。,"The Retired Emperor, abandoning his plans to attend court, removed his ceremonial robes and sat in simple white silk with a monk’s robe draped over it, reciting prayers from the depths of his heart."
23,36,小松殿には、盛國承て著到附けり。,"At Komatsu-dono, Masunori arrived as ordered."
23,37,馳参たる勢共、一萬餘騎とぞ註いたる。,The assembled force numbered over ten thousand riders.
23,38,著到披見の後、大臣中門に出て侍共に宣けるは、日比の契約を違へずして参たるこそ神妙なれ。,"After reviewing the troops, the minister exited through the middle gate and addressed his retainers: “By honoring our oath to the Sun Goddess, you have come without fail—a divine act indeed.”"
23,39,異國にさる,In foreign lands—
23,40,ためし有り。,there is precedent.
23,41,周の幽王、褒,"King You of Zhou, his favorite concubine Bao—"
23,42,じと云最愛の后をもち給へり。,held the most beloved queen—
23,43,天下第一の美人なり。,the foremost beauty in all the land.
23,44,され共幽王の御心にかなはざりける事は、褒,"Yet King You’s heart was never satisfied, and Bao—"
23,45,じ笑をふくまずとて、惣て此后笑ふ事をし給はず。,"refusing to smile, would not grant him even a single laugh thereafter."
23,46,異國の習には、天下に兵革起る時、所々に火を擧げ、大鼓を撃て、兵を召す謀有り。,"In foreign customs, when war breaks out, beacon fires are lit and great drums beaten to summon troops."
23,47,是を烽火と名付たり。,This is called a beacon fire.
23,48,或時天下に兵亂起て、烽火を揚たりければ、后は見給ひて、「あな不思議、火もあれ程多かりけるな。,"When war erupted and beacon fires were lit, the queen would gaze at them and say, “How strange! So many fires burning—"
23,49,」とて、其時始て笑給へり。,and only then would she smile.
23,50,此后一度笑ば百の媚有りけり。,"Thus, one smile held a hundred charms."
23,51,幽王嬉き事にして、其事となう、常に烽火を擧給ふ。,King You delighted in this and frequently ordered beacon fires lit.
23,52,諸侯来に寇なし。,The诸侯 would come running—though no invasion was ever underway.
23,53,寇なければ即ち去ぬ。,"When they found no enemy, they departed."
23,54,加樣にする事度々に及べば、参る者も無りけり。,"Repeatedly tricked in this way, none came again."
23,55,或時隣国より凶賊起て、幽王の都を攻けるに、烽火をあぐれ共、例の后の火に慣て、兵も参らず。,"When enemy troops from a neighboring state finally attacked, the king lit beacon fires in panic. Yet, accustomed to the queen’s games, the soldiers ignored them."
23,56,其時都傾て、幽王終に亡にき。,"The capital fell, and King You perished."
23,57,さてこの後は野干と成て走失けるぞ怖き。,Thus ended his reign—a tragic tale indeed.
23,58,か様の事在なれば、自今以後も、是より召んには、みなかくの如くに参るべし。,"Let this serve as a lesson: henceforth, when summoned, all shall act accordingly."
23,59,重盛不思議の事を聞出して召つるなり。,Shigemori has called us to a strange enterprise—
23,60,され共此事聞直しつ、僻事にてありけり。,"but upon hearing the details, it is clearly misguided."
23,61,疾う／＼歸れ。,Return at once!
23,62,」とて、皆歸されけり。,Thus they dispersed.
23,63,実にはさせる事をも聞出されざりけれ共父を諫め被申つる詞に順ひ、我身に勢の著か、著ぬかの程をも知り、又父子軍をせんとにはあらねども、角して入道相国の謀反の志も和げ給ふとの謀也。,"Though the true plan was never revealed, obeying my father’s plea to dissuade him, I learned that even if we could not rally our forces, we must still appease the priestly regent’s treacherous intentions."
23,64,「君雖不君、不可臣以下臣、父雖不父不可子以不子。君の爲には忠有て、父の爲には孝あれ。」と文宣王の宣けるに不違。,"As the Duke of Zhou taught: ‘Even if a ruler is unworthy, one must not abandon loyalty. Even if a father fails, one must not forsake filial piety.’"
23,65,君の此由聞召て、「今に始ぬ事なれ共、内府が心の中こそ愧しけれ。あたをば恩を以て報ぜられたり。」とぞ仰ける。,"Upon hearing this, the Lord replied: “Though it is late now, the Naifu’s heart is filled with shame. You have been repaid through grace.”"
23,66,「果報こそ目出たうて、大臣の大將にこそ至らめ。容儀帶佩人に勝れ、才智才學さへ世に超たるべしやは。」とぞ時の人々感じ合れける。,"“Though his retribution is just, he should never have risen to Grand General. His bearing surpasses even the most refined courtiers, and his wisdom transcends all.” so spoke the people."
23,67,「國に諫る臣あれ,“Let there be counselors who admonish their nation—
23,68,ば、其国心安く、家に諫る子あれば、其家必たゞし。,"and the nation will prosper. Let there be children who admonish their families, and the family shall endure."
23,69,」と云へり。,” they declared.
23,70,上古にも末代にも有がたかりし大臣なり。,Shigemori was a minister unparalleled in both ancient and modern times.
24,0,同六月二日、新大納言成親卿をば、公卿の座へ出し奉て、御物参せたりけれども、胸せき塞て、御箸をだにもたてられず。,"On the second day of the sixth month, Shin Dainagon Narihira no kō was brought to his court position and presented with food, yet could not bring himself to take even a single bite due to a constricted heart."
24,1,御車を寄て、とう／＼と申せば、大納言心ならず乘り給ふ。,"When urged, 'Please enter the imperial carriage,' the Dainagon nevertheless refused to ride, his heart unyielding."
24,2,軍兵共前後左右に打圍みたり。,"Soldiers surrounded him from front and back, left and right."
24,3,我方の者は一人もなし。,Not a single ally remained among us.
24,4,「今一度小松殿に見え奉らばや。」とのたまへども、其も叶はず。,"'If only I could once more pay respects to the Lord of Komatsu.' This plea was made, yet granted not."
24,5,「縱重科を蒙て遠國へ行く者も、人一人身に順へぬ者やある。」と車の内にてかき口説かれければ、守護の武士共も皆鎧の袖をぞぬらしける。,"Within the carriage, it was whispered, 'Even those who receive leniency and depart to distant lands may lack proper attire.' Upon hearing this, all the guards' armored sleeves grew damp with tears."
24,6,西の朱雀を南へ行ば、大内山も今は餘所にぞ見給ける。,"Traveling south along the Western Suzaku Avenue, even the Imperial Hill now appeared diminished in its former glory."
24,7,年來見馴奉りし雜色牛飼に至るまで、涙を流し袖を絞らぬはなかりけり。,"Even the familiar ox-herders who had served for years wept, wringing their sleeves with tears."
24,8,増て都に殘りとゞまり給ふ北方少き人々の心の中、推量れて哀也。,"The hearts of the few remaining northerners in the capital, their sorrows multiplied, stirred profound compassion."
24,9,鳥羽殿を過給ふにも、此御所へ御幸なりしには、一度も御供には外れざりし物をとて、我山庄洲濱殿とてありしをも、餘所に見てこそ通られけれ。,"Though passing the Toba Palace, even this one who had never been excluded from imperial processions to this very residence—my humble Shōshūden mansion—was now viewed as a stranger."
24,10,南の門へ出て、舟遅とぞ急がせける。,"Emerging from the Southern Gate, they urgently hastened to secure the boat."
24,11,「こは何地へやらん、同う失はるべくば、都近き此邊にてもあれかし。」と宣けるぞ責ての事なる。,"'Where shall we go? If we must be exiled, at least let us remain near the capital!' This became the accusation hurled at them."
24,12,近う副たる武士を、「誰そ」と問給へば、難波次郎経遠と申す。,"When asked, 'Who are you?' of a nearby subordinate warrior, he replied, 'I am Naniwa no Jirō Tsunetoshi.'"
24,13,「若此邊に我方樣の者やある。舟に乘ぬ先に言置べき事あり。尋て参せよ。」と宣ひければ、其邊をはしりまはて尋けれども、,"'If there are any of our faction here, inform them before boarding. Inquire immediately.' Thus commanded, they rushed about searching—but"
24,14,我こそ大納言殿の御方と云者一人もなし。,not a single person claiming to be associated with the Dainagon could be found.
24,15,「我世なりし時は、隨ひついたりし者共、一二千人も有つらん。今は餘所にてだにも此有樣を見送る者の無りける悲さよ。」と泣れければ、猛き武士共もみな袖をぞぬらしける。,"'In my prime, I had a retinue of over a thousand followers. Now not even one remains to bid me farewell—what bitter sorrow!' As he wept, even the fiercest warriors' sleeves grew damp."
24,16,身にそふ物とてはたゞつきせぬ涙計也。,The only thing accompanying him was an endless supply of tears—this was his sole possession.
24,17,熊野詣、天王寺詣などには、二瓦の三棟に造たる舟に乘り、次の船二三十艘漕つゞけてこそ有しに、今は怪かるかきすゑ屋形舟に、大幕引せ、見もなれぬ兵共に具せられて、今日を限に都を出て、浪路遙に赴れけん心の中、推量れて哀なり。,"For pilgrimages to Kumano or Tendai-ji, he had ridden in a three-decked boat adorned with two-layered tiles, accompanied by twenty or thirty escort vessels. Now, however, strange-shaped skiffs with drawn curtains bore him forth, guarded by unfamiliar soldiers—this was the vessel that would carry him on his final journey from the capital, bound for distant seas. The heartsick despair of this situation stirred profound pity."
24,18,其日は攝津國大物の浦に著給ふ。,"On that day, they arrived at Ōmoto Bay in Settsu Province."
24,19,新大納言、既に死罪に行はるべかりし人の、流罪に宥られける事は、小松殿のやう／＼に申されけるに依てなり。,The New Dainagon's commutation from capital punishment to exile was due to a plea made by the Lord of Komatsu.
24,20,此人いまだ中納言にておはしける時、美濃國を知行し給ひしに嘉応元年の冬、目代右衞門尉正友が許へ山門の領平野庄の神人が葛を賣てきたりけるに、目代酒に飮醉て葛に墨をぞ付たりける。,"When this man was still Middle Counselor, governing Mino Province during the winter of Kagen'ei 1st year, a deputy captain named Masatomo, drunk on duty, had thrown ink at a shrine priestess selling kudzu from Hirono Manor—a mountain temple's territory."
24,21,神人惡口に及ぶ間、さないはせそとて散々に陵礫す。,"During the priestess' angry rebuke, he brazenly defiled her with further insults."
24,22,さる程に神人共數百人、目代が許へ亂入す。,"Enraged, hundreds of shrine followers stormed the deputy's quarters."
24,23,目代法に任せて防ぎければ、神人等十餘人打殺さる。,"In attempting to resist under legal authority, over a dozen shrine followers were killed."
24,24,是によて同年の十一月三日、山門の大衆おびたゞしう蜂起して、國司成親卿を流罪に處せられ、目代右衞門尉正友を禁獄せらるべき由奏聞す。,"Thus, on the third day of the eleventh month of that same year, the mountain temple's masses rebelled, leading to Counselor Narihira being exiled and deputy captain Masatomo imprisoned—a matter submitted to the throne."
24,25,既に成親卿備中國へ流さるべきにて西の七條迄出されたりしを、君いかゞ思召されけん、中五日在て召返さる。,"Though already en route to Bizen Province for exile, having departed as far as Nishinotōji (West Seventh Avenue), His Majesty recalled him after five days of deliberation."
24,26,山門の大衆おびただしう呪咀すと聞えしか共、同二年正月五日、右衞門督を兼して、檢非違使の別當に成給ふ。,"Despite hearing reports of the mountain temple's widespread curses, on the fifth day of the first month of the following year, he was appointed Captain of the Right Guards and Chief Inspector of Law Enforcement."
24,27,其時、資方、兼雅卿越えられ給へり。,"At this time, Jirō Tsunetoshi served under Michifusa and Kaneyasu no kō."
24,28,資方卿はふるい人おとなにておはしき。,Michifusa was an elder statesman of long standing.
24,29,兼雅卿は榮華の人也。,Kaneyasu was a man of refined elegance.
24,30,家嫡にて越えられ給けるこそ遺恨なれ。,It is regrettable that the succession passed to Kaneyasu rather than Michifusa's line.
24,31,是は三條殿造進の賞也。,This was due to his contributions in the construction of Sanjō Palace.
24,32,同三年四月十三日、正,"On April 13th of the same year's third year, he was"
24,33,二位に叙せらる。,promoted to Senior Second Rank.
24,34,其時は中御門中納言宗家卿越えられ給へり。,"At the time, Munehisa no kō of Chūnagon Gate held court."
24,35,安元元年十月二十七日、前中納言より權大納言に上り給ふ。,"On October 27th of Angen 1st year, he ascended from former Middle Counselor to Junior Great Councilor."
24,36,人嘲て、「山門の大衆にはのろはるべかりけるものを。」と申ける。,"People mocked, 'He who was destined for the mountain temple's curse.'"
24,37,されども、今は其故にや、かゝる憂目に逢給へり。,"Yet now, precisely because of that very reason, he faces such dire circumstances."
24,38,凡は神明の罰も人の呪咀も、疾もあり、遅きもあり、不同なる事也。,"Indeed, divine retribution and human curses alike—some swift in coming, others delayed. Their workings are not uniform."
24,39,同三日、大物の浦へ、京より御使有とて犇きけり。,"On the third day of that same period, an imperial envoy rushed to Ōmoto Bay from Kyoto."
24,40,新大納言「其にて失へとにや。」と聞給へば、さはなくして、備前の兒島へ流すべしとの御使なり。,"Hearing the New Dainagon lament, 'Thus we are undone,' the envoy declared: 'He is to be exiled to Kojima of Bizen.'"
24,41,小松殿より御文有り。,A letter arrived from the Lord of Komatsu.
24,42,「如何にもして、都近き片山里にも置奉らばやと、さしも申つれども叶はぬ事こそ、世に有かひも候はね。さりながらも御命ばかりは申請て候。」とて、難波が許へも、「構てよく／＼宮仕へ御心に違な。」と仰られ遣し、旅の粧細々と沙汰し送られたり。,"'Though I earnestly requested placement in a nearby hamlet like Katayama, it was denied—such things are beyond worldly influence. Yet we dare not defy imperial command.' Thus the Lord dispatched urgent instructions: 'Ensure the utmost care in royal service. Prepare all manner of travel provisions.'"
24,43,新大納言はさしも忝う思召されける君にも離れ参せ、つかの間もさりがたう思はれける北方少き人々にも別はてゝ、「こは何地へやらん、再び故郷に歸て、妻子を相見んことも有がたし。一年山門の訴訟によて、流れしをば君惜ませ給ひて、西の七條より召還されぬ。是はされば君の御誡にもあらず。こは如何にしつる事ぞや。」と、天に仰ぎ地に俯て、泣悲めどもかひぞなき。,"The New Dainagon, though summoned by his Lord to depart, and after parting from the few northern retainers who temporarily shared his fate, lamented: 'Where shall we go? To return home and reunite with my wife would be bliss. For a year I was exiled due to the mountain temple's litigation, yet recalled from Nishinotōji at Your Majesty's mercy. This act is beyond comprehension.' Kneeling in heavenward gaze and earthward despair, he wept without solace."
24,44,明ぬれば舟おし出いて下り給ふに、道すがらも只涙に咽んで、ながらふべしとはおぼえねど、さすが露の命は消やらず。,"At dawn, as the boat pushed off, he swallowed his tears along the way—though aware he should endure. Yet mortal life persists, even as its dew-like transience fades."
24,45,跡の白浪隔つれば、都は次第に遠ざかり、日數やう／＼重なれば、遠國は近附けり。,"With the white waves between, the capital receded. As days passed, distant lands grew near."
24,46,備前の兒島に漕よせて、民の家のあさましげなる柴の庵に置奉る。,"Arriving at Kojima of Bizen, he was placed in a thatched hut—crude shelter among the people's homes."
24,47,島のならひ、後は山、前は海、磯の松風、波の音、いづれも哀は盡せず。,"This island, backed by mountains and facing sea, with pine winds whispering from the shore and waves moaning—every sound was a dirge of endless sorrow."
25,0,大納言一人にもかぎらず、警を蒙る輩多かりけり。,Not only the Great Minister but many others were under guard.
25,1,近江中將入道蓮淨佐渡國、山城守基兼伯耆國、式部大輔正綱播磨國、宗判官信房阿波國、新平判官資行は美作國とぞ聞えし。,"It was known that the Minister of the Left Middle Palace (Jinchu) Retired Monk Rennjo in Sado Province, Governor Ki-ken of Yamashiro, Shikibu Daibu Masatane of Harima, Sangi判官 Nobutaka of Awa, and Shinpei判官 Michiyuki of Mimasaka were among them."
25,2,其比入道相國、福原の別業に御座けるが、同廿日、攝津左衞門盛澄を使者として、門脇の宰相の許へ、「存ずる旨あり。丹波少將急ぎ是へたべ。」と宣ひ遣はされたりければ、宰相、「さらば、たゞ有し時ともかくも成たりせばいかがせむ。今更物を思はせんこそ悲しけれ。」とて、福原へ下給べき由宣へば、少將泣々出立給ひけり。,"The Retired Lord Regent, residing at his secondary estate in Fukuhara, sent a messenger on the 20th day: Tsunesada, Left卫門 of Settsu. 'Inform His Excellency the Minister that urgent matters require Danba Shogun to come immediately.' Upon hearing this, the Minister sighed, 'If only we could resolve this in good time... Now it grieves me to reconsider.' When ordered to depart for Fukuhara, the young general tearfully stood ready."
25,3,女房達は、叶ざらん物故に、猶も唯宰相の申されよかしとぞ歎かれける。,"The court ladies lamented, 'Alas, we can only hope the Minister's wishes will be granted.'"
25,4,宰相、「存る程の事は申つ。世を捨るより外は、今は何事をか申べき。されども縱何くの浦に坐すとも、我命の有ん限は、訪奉るべし。」とぞ宣ける。,"The Minister declared, 'I must acknowledge the truth. Now that I have renounced the world, what else is there to say? Though cast into any distant shore, my days are numbered and will come to an end.'"
25,5,少將は今年三つに成給ふをさなき人を持給へり。,"The young general, now three years old, had been raised by a devoted nursemaid."
25,6,日ごろはわかき人にて君達などの事もさしも濃にも坐ざりしか共、今はの時になりしかば、さすが心にやかゝられけん。,"Though usually composed beyond his years, the present crisis stirred genuine emotion in him."
25,7,「此少き者を今一度見ばや。」とこそ宣ひけれ。,"He said, 'Let us see this child one last time.'"
25,8,乳母抱て参りたり。,The nursemaid came carrying the infant.
25,9,少將膝上に置、髮かき撫で、涙をはら／＼と流して、「哀汝七歳に成ば、男に成して君へ参せんとこそ思つれ。され共今は云かひなし。もし命生て、生たちたらば、法師に成り、我後の世弔へよ。」と宣へば、いまだ幼き心に、何事をか聞わき給ふべきなれども、打點頭給へば、少將を始奉て母上乳母の女房、其座に竝居たる人々、心有も心無も、皆袖をぞ濡しける。,"Placing the child on his lap, he combed its hair and wept: 'When you grow to seven years old, become a man and serve your lord. For now, I cannot speak further. Should you survive, become a monk to honor my spirit in the next life.' Though too young to comprehend, the boy bowed. The general, his mother, nursemaid, and attendants—all wept silently."
25,10,福原の御使、やがて今夜鳥羽まで出させ給ふべき,The imperial envoy from Fukuhara was to depart tonight for the capital of Uji.
25,11,由申ければ、「幾程も延ざらん者故に、今宵許は、都の内にて明さばや。」と宣へ共、頻に申せば、其夜鳥羽へぞ出られける。,"When informed, 'Due to delays, we shall depart tonight and reach the capital by morning,' repeated requests secured his immediate departure that night."
25,12,宰相餘にうらめしさに、今度は乘も具し給はず。,"The Minister, overcome with sorrow, prepared no carriage for this journey."
25,13,同廿二日福原へ下著給ひたりければ、太政入道瀬尾太郎兼康に仰て、備中國へぞ流されける。,"On the 22nd, after descending to Fukuhara, he was exiled to Bitchu Province under orders from Retired Prime Minister Saeo no Tarou Kiyoakira."
25,14,兼康は宰相の還聞給はん所を恐れて、道すがらも様々に痛り慰め奉る。,"Kiyoakira, fearing the Minister's wrath, repeatedly comforted him along the way."
25,15,され共、少將少も慰み給ふ事もなし。,Yet he showed no compassion for the young general.
25,16,夜晝只佛の御名をのみ唱て父の事をぞ嘆かれける。,"Day and night, the boy chanted Buddhist prayers, mourning his father's fate."
25,17,新大納言は、備前の兒島に御座けるを、預の武士難波次郎経遠是は猶舟津近うて惡かりなんとて、地へ渡奉り、備前備中兩國の境、庭瀬の郷有木の別所と云ふ山寺に置奉る。,"The New Dainagon, residing on児岛 in Bizen Province, ordered his steward Naniwa no Jiro Tsunetada to relocate him from the dangerous coastal area to a mountain temple called Aoki no Betso at the border of Bizen and Bitchu provinces."
25,18,備中の瀬尾と、備前の有木の別所の間は、僅五十町に足ぬ所なれば、丹波少將其方の風もさすが懷うや思はれけむ、或時兼康を召て、「是より大納言殿の御渡有なる備中の有木の別所へは、如何程の道ぞ。」と問給へば、直に知せ奉ては、惡かりなんと思ひけむ、「片道十二三で候。」と申。,"The distance between Saeo in Bitchu and Aoki no Betso in Bizen was barely fifty cho (about 5 km). Suspecting Danba Shogun's whereabouts, he summoned Kiyoakira: 'How far is it to the Dainagon's destination?' Though eager for an answer, Kiyoakira sighed, 'Twelve or thirteen cho one way.'"
25,19,其時少將涙をはらはらと流いて、「日本は昔三十三箇國にて有けるを、中比六十六箇国には分られたんなり。,"The young general wept: 'Though Japan was once 33 provinces, now divided into 66—'"
25,20,さ云ふ備前備中備後も、本は一國にて有ける也。,"Even Bizen, Bitchu, and Bingo were originally one province."
25,21,又東に聞ゆる出羽陸奧兩國も、昔は六十六郡が一國にてありけるを、其時十二郡を割分て、出羽の國とは立られたり。,And Dewa and Mutsu in the east—once 66 districts forming one nation—were split into twelve districts to create Dewa Province.
25,22,されば實方中將、奧州へ流されたりける時、此國の名所阿古耶の松と云所を見ばやとて、國中を尋ありきけるが、尋かねて歸りける道に、老翁の一人行逢たりければ『やゝ御邊はふるい人とこそ見奉れ、當國の名所に阿古屋の松と云ふ所やしりたる。,"When the Practical Middle General was exiled to Mutsu, he sought Akoja's Pine, a famed site. Returning empty-handed, he met an old man who said: 'Ah, noble sir—you seek Akoja's Pine in our province.'"
25,23,』と問に、『全く當國の内には候はず、出羽の國にや候らん。,"The general asked, 'But surely it lies within these borders?' The man replied, 'No—it belongs to Dewa Province.'"
25,24,』と申ければ、『さては御邊も知ざりけり。,The general sighed: 'Then even you are unaware.'
25,25,世末に成て、,"In these troubled times,"
25,26,國の名所をも早皆呼失ひけるにこそ。,even the names of our ancestral landmarks have been forgotten.
25,27,』とて、空しく過んとしければ、老翁中將の袖を控へて、『あはれ君は、みちのくの阿古耶の松に木隱て、出べき月の出もやらぬか。,"The man gripped the general's sleeve: 'Alas, your song of Michinoku (Mutsu) speaks of hiding behind Akoja's Pine to await the moon—but now even this place is lost.'"
25,28,と云ふ歌の心を以て、當國の名所阿古耶の松とは仰られ候か。,This was the meaning of your ancestral song.'
25,29,其は兩國が一國なりし時詠侍る歌なり。,Composed when Dewa and Mutsu were united.
25,30,十二郡を割分て後は、出羽國にや候らん。,"Now, after the division into twelve districts, it belongs to Dewa.'"
25,31,』と申ければ、さらばとて、實方中將も出羽國に越てこそ阿古耶の松をば見たりけれ。,"Thus, the Practical Middle General crossed into Dewa Province to see Akoja's Pine."
25,32,筑紫の太宰府より都へ、腹赤の使の上るこそ、かた路十五日とは定たれ。,The journey from Dazaifu in Chikuzen to the capital took fifteen days by land.
25,33,既に十二三日と云は、是より殆鎮西へ下向ごさんなれ。,"Having traveled twelve or thirteen days, it was almost time to head westward."
25,34,遠しと云とも、備前備中の間、兩三日にはよもすぎじ。,"Though distant, the distance between Bizen and Bitchu could be traversed in two or three days."
25,35,近きを遠う申は、大納言殿の御渡有なる所を成経に知せじとてこそ申らめ。,"The general lied about the proximity, for he truly did not know the Dainagon's route."
25,36,」とて、其後は戀しけれ共問ひ給はず。,"From then on, though pained by curiosity, he asked no more questions."
26,0,さる程に法勝寺の執行俊寛僧都、平判官康頼、この少將相具して薩摩潟鬼界が島へぞ流されける。,"Thus, the monk Jūkan of Hōshō-ji Temple and Taira no Yasuyori, the Assistant Judge, both officials of the Junior General rank, were exiled to Kibitsu Island at Sakumo-gata."
26,1,彼島は、都を出て遙々と波路を凌で行く處なり。,"That island lies far from the capital, requiring a long sea voyage across turbulent waves."
26,2,おぼろげにては船もかよはず。,Even ships rarely venture there in the朦胧 of distance.
26,3,島には人稀なり。,The island is sparsely populated.
26,4,自ら人はあれども、此土の人にも似ず。,"Though people exist there, they bear no resemblance to those of this land."
26,5,色黒うして牛の如し。,Their skin is as dark as oxen.
26,6,身には頻に毛生つゝ、言詞をも聞知らず。,"Hair grows densely upon their bodies, and they cannot speak intelligible words."
26,7,男は烏帽子もせず、女は髮もさげざりけり。,"Men wear no hats, nor do women tie up their hair."
26,8,衣裳なければ人にも似ず。,"Without clothing, they bear little resemblance to humans."
26,9,食する物も無ければ、唯殺生をのみ先とす。,They have no food but make killing living things their first priority.
26,10,賤が山田をかへさねば、米穀の類もなく、薗の桑をとらざれば、絹帛の類も無りけり。,"Without low-born farmers tending fields, there is no grain; without gathering mulberry leaves from groves, there is no silk."
26,11,島のなかには高き山有り。,Within the island stands a lofty mountain.
26,12,鎮に火燃ゆ。,"At its peak, fire burns continuously."
26,13,硫,Sulfur
26,14,黄と云ふ物充滿てり。,And yellow [sulfur] fills the air.
26,15,かるが故に硫黄が島とも名附たり。,Hence it is also called the Island of Sulfur.
26,16,雷常に鳴上り、鳴下り、麓には雨しげし。,"Thunder rumbles above and below; at its base, rain falls incessantly."
26,17,一日片時、人の命堪て有るべき樣もなし。,No human life can endure even a single moment there.
26,18,さる程に新大納言は少しくつろぐ事もやと思はれけるに、子息丹波少將成経も、はや鬼界が島へ流され給ぬときいて、今はさのみつれなく何事をか期すべきとて、出家の志の候よし、便に付て小松殿へ申されければ、此由法皇に窺ひ申て、御免ありけり。,"The New Dainagon, though he had momentarily resigned himself to despair, heard that his son Danba Shōgun Naritsune too was soon to be exiled to Kibitsu. With no hope left, he resolved to become a monk and sought permission from the Cloistered Emperor via the Konomine Palace."
26,19,やがて出家し給ひぬ。,He soon took monastic vows.
26,20,榮花の袂を引かへて、浮世を餘所の墨染の袖にぞ窶れ給ふ。,He drew back the hem of his worldly splendor and let it fall into the indigo-dyed sleeve of the Other World.
26,21,大納言の北方は、都の北山雲林院の邊にしのびてぞ御座ける。,The Dainagon's northern residence lay hidden near Kumrin-in Temple on the northern mountains of the capital.
26,22,さらぬだに、住馴ぬ處は物うきに、いとゞしのばれければ、過行く月日も明し兼ね暮し煩ふ樣なりけり。,"Though strangers to the place, they grew fond of their seclusion. Yet as days passed without end, both light and darkness became burdensome."
26,23,女房侍多かりけれども、或は世を恐れ、或は人目をつゝむ程に、問訪ふ者一人もなし。,"Though many attendants served him, none dared visit out of fear or shame."
26,24,され共其中に、源左衞門尉信俊と云ふ侍一人、情殊に深かりければ、常に訪奉る。,"Yet one retainer, Minamoto Saburō-no-jō Nobutomo, who bore special affection for him, visited faithfully."
26,25,或時北方信俊を召て、「まことや是には備前の兒島と聞えしが、此程聞ば有木の別所とかやに御座なり。如何にもして今一度はかなき筆の跡をも奉り、御音信をも聞ばや。」とこそ宣ひけれ。,"One day, the Northern Resident summoned Nobutomo: 'Indeed I heard this is near Bizen's Okishima. Now that you've arrived at Aoki no Sekisho [Aokibeikyō], please send a final letter and words of farewell.'"
26,26,信俊涙を押へ申けるは、「幼少より、御憐を蒙て、片時も離れ参せ候はず。御下の時も、何共して御供仕らうと申候しが、六波羅より容されねば力及候はず。召され候し御聲も耳に留り、諫められ參らせし御詞も肝に銘じて片時も忘れ参らせ候はず。縱此身は如何なる目にも遇候へ。疾々御文賜はて參り候はん。」とぞ申ける。,"Nobutomo, suppressing tears: 'Since childhood, I have served you without a day's separation. Even when you departed for Rokuhara [Imperial Palace], though eager to accompany you, my strength was denied. Your voice still echoes in my ears; your words of counsel burn in my heart. Whatever fate awaits me, please grant me one last letter! I shall hasten to deliver it.'"
26,27,北方斜ならず悦で、やがて書てぞたうだりける。,"Overjoyed, the Northern Resident promptly composed a reply."
26,28,少人々も面々に御文有り。,The letter contained many layers of meaning.
26,29,信俊此を賜はて、遙々と備前國有木の別所へ尋下る。,Nobutomo received it and journeyed far to Aoki no Sekisho in Bizen Province.
26,30,先預の武士難波次郎経遠,"The senior retainer, Naniwa Jirō Tsunetada,"
26,31,に案内を云ければ、志の程を感じて、やがて見參に入たりけり。,guided him inward after sensing his determination.
26,32,大納言入道殿は、唯今も都の事をのみ宣出し、歎沈で御座ける所に、「京より信俊が參て候。」と申入たりければ、「夢かや。」とて聞もあへず、起なほり、「是へ／＼。」と召されければ、信俊參て見奉るに、先御住ひの心憂さもさる事にて、墨染の御袂を見奉るにぞ、信俊目もくれ心も消て覺えける。,"The Dainagon, absorbed in lamenting the capital and sunk in despair, heard Nobutomo's arrival. 'A dream? Impossible!' he cried out, rising to see him. Moved by his former residence's state—now abandoned—the indigo-dyed hem of his robe struck Nobutomo dumb with grief."
26,33,北方の仰蒙し次第、細々と申て、御文とりいだいて奉る。,The Northern Resident recounted events in detail and retrieved the letter.
26,34,是を開けて見給へば、水莖の跡は、涙にかき暮て、そことは見ね共、「少き人々の餘に戀悲み給ふ有樣、我身も盡ぬ思に堪忍べうもなし。」と書かれたれば、日來の戀しさは、事の數ならずとぞ悲み給ふ。,"Opening it, he saw tear-stained passages: 'Though few remain to mourn you, I cannot bear my endless grief. Even the briefest farewell would ease this pain.' The accumulated sorrow of days overwhelmed him."
26,35,かくて四五日過ければ、信俊「是に候て、御最後の御有様見參せん。」と申ければ、預の武士難波次郎経遠、叶まじき由頻に申せば、力及ばで、「さらば上れ。」とこそ宣けれ。,"After five days, Nobutomo declared: 'Let me see your final state.' Naniwa Jirō protested fiercely but was overruled: 'He must come.'"
26,36,「我は近う失はれんずらむ。此世になき者と聞ば、相構て我後世とぶらへ。」とぞ宣ける。,"The Dainagon replied: 'I shall soon perish. When you hear of my death, arrange for my rebirth.'"
26,37,御返事かいてたうだりければ、信俊是を賜て、「又こそ參候はめ。」とて暇申て出ければ、「汝が又來ん度を待つくべしとも覺えぬぞ。あまりにしたはしくおぼゆるに、暫暫。」と宣ひて、度々呼ぞ返されける。,"After writing a reply, Nobutomo sought leave to return. 'I shall come again,' he said. But the Dainagon: 'Your return is unforeseeable. I am too faint. Wait here briefly.' He called him back repeatedly."
26,38,さても有べきならねば、信俊涙を抑つゝ、都へ歸のぼりけり。,"Compelled to leave, Nobutomo ascended the capital, tears unshed."
26,39,北方に文參らせたりければ、是を開て御覽ずるに、早出家し給たると覺敷て、御髮の一房文の奧に有けるを、二目とも見給はず。,"When the Northern Resident received his letter, learning of the Dainagon's immediate tonsure, he could not bear to look at a single lock of his hair."
26,40,形見こそ中々今はあたなれとて、臥まろびてぞ泣かれける。,This final relic moved him to weep lying down.
26,41,少き人々も、聲々に泣き悲み給けり。,Even the few attendants lamented aloud.
26,42,さる程に大納言入道殿をば同八月十九日、備前備中兩國の境、庭瀬の郷、吉備の中山といふ處にて終に失ひ奉る。,"Thus, on the 19th day of the eighth month, the Dainagon-Enlightened One perished at Nagese Village, Mount Yoshii in Bizen/Bitchū border."
26,43,其最期の有様やう／＼に聞えけり。,Accounts of his final moments were told:
26,44,酒に毒を入てすゝめたりけれども,"They poisoned him with wine,"
26,45,叶はざりければ、岸の二丈許有ける下にひしを植て、上より突落し奉れば、ひしに貫かて失給ぬ。,"When that failed, they tied him with vines to a cliff 2 zhang high and hurled him down, piercing his body."
26,46,無下にうたてき事共也本少うぞ覺えける。,These unrecorded details are lost to history.
26,47,大納言の北方は此世に無き人と聞給ひて、如何にもして今一度かはらぬ姿を見もし見えんとてこそ、今日迄様をも変ざりつれ。,"When the Northern Resident learned of his death, longing to see his unchanged form, he altered his appearance daily."
26,48,今は何にかはせんとて、菩提院と云寺に御座し、様を変へ、かたの如くの佛事を營み後世をぞ弔らひ給ひける。,"Now residing in Jōdo-in Temple, he transformed his form and performed rigorous rituals to console the departed."
26,49,この北方と申は、山城守敦方の娘也。,"This Northern Resident was the daughter of Yamashiro-no-kami Atsumichi,"
26,50,勝たる美人にて、後白河法皇の御最愛ならびなき御思人にて御座けるを、成親卿ありがたき寵愛の人にて賜はれたりけるとぞ聞えし。,a famed beauty who captivated the Cloistered Emperor Goshirakawa and was bestowed upon Sanezumi no Ōkimi with imperial favor.
26,51,をさなき人人も花を手折り、閼伽の水を掬んで、父の後世を弔ひ給ふぞ哀なる。,"Even commoners, gathering flowers and scooping sacred water to mourn his rebirth, lamented deeply."
26,52,さる程に時移り事去て、世の替行有様は只天人の五衰に異ならず。,"Thus time passed, and the world's vicissitudes mirrored the Five Decay Signs of Tien Ren—inescapable decline."
27,0,愛に徳大寺の大納言実定卿は、平家の次男宗盛卿に大將を越されて、暫籠居し給へり。,"Because of love, the Grand Councilor Sadatada-no-kyō of Tokudaiji was temporarily confined after being surpassed as Great General by Munemori-kyō, the second son of the Heike."
27,1,出家せんと宣へば、諸大夫侍共、いかがせんと嘆合り。,"When it was declared that he would become a monk, the various courtiers and attendants lamented what to do."
27,2,其中に藤藏人重兼と云ふ諸大夫あり。,"Among them was Shigekane Fuji, a Senior Courtier."
27,3,諸事に心得たる人にて、或月の夜、實定卿南面の御格子を開けて、只獨月に嘯て御座る処に、慰さめまゐらせんとや思ひけん、藤藏人參りたり。,"Being well-versed in matters, on a certain night when Sadatada-no-kyō opened the southern lattice window of his quarters and sat alone sighing beneath the moon, Shigekane came to console him."
27,4,「誰そ。」「重兼候。」「如何になに事ぞ。」と宣へば、「今夜は特に月さえて万心のすみ候まゝに、參て候。」,"""Who is it?"" ""It is Shigekane,"" he replied. When asked, ""What brings you here?"" he said, ""Tonight the moon especially illuminates all hearts; I have come to pay my respects."""
27,5,大納言、「神妙に參たり。餘りに何とやらん心細うて徒然なるに。」とぞ仰られける。,"The Grand Councilor said, ""You have come with divine grace. Yet there remains this lingering anxiety and futility."""
27,6,其後何と無い事共申て慰め奉る。,Thereafter he spoke of various unremarkable matters to console him.
27,7,大納言宣けるは、「倩此世の中の有樣を見るに、平家の世は彌盛なり。,"The Grand Councilor declared, ""Observing the state of this world, I see that the Heike clan continues to flourish."
27,8,入道相國の嫡子、,"The legitimate son of the Priest-Regent,"
27,9,次男、左右の大將にてあり。,the second son serves as both Left and Right Great Generals.
27,10,やがて三男知盛、嫡孫維盛もあるぞかし。,"Moreover, the third son Tomomori and the legitimate grandchild Koremori are likewise present."
27,11,彼も是も次第にならば、他家の人々、大將をいつ當附べしともおぼえず。,"Should this continue, even retainers of other houses would forget to whom they should owe fealty for the position."
27,12,されば終の事なり。,Thus it must end here.
27,13,出家せん。,I shall become a monk.
27,14,」とぞ宣ける。,""""
27,15,重兼涙をはら／＼と流して申けるは、「君の御出家候なば、御内の上下皆惑者に成候ひなんず。重兼、珍い事をこそ案出して候へ。,"Shigekane wept, saying, ""Should Your Lordship become a monk, all within the palace will be thrown into confusion. I propose something rare indeed."
27,16,譬ば安藝の嚴島をば、平家斜ならず崇敬はれ候に、何かは苦しう候べき、彼宮へ御參あり、御祈誓候へかし。,"Consider, for instance, the Sacred Island of Itsukushima in Aki. Though not particularly revered by the Heike, if Your Lordship were to visit and make vows there..."

27,34,徳大寺の邸へ入させ給ひて、様々にもてなし、様々の御引出物共たうでかへされけり。,"Upon entering Tokudaiji's estate, they received lavish hospitality and numerous farewell gifts."
27,35,内侍共これまで上る程では、我等が主の太政入道殿へいかで參らであるべきとて、西八條へぞ参じたる。,"The attendants, having never before ascended to the capital, decided to visit the Regent at West Hachijō."
27,36,入道相國急ぎ出合給ひて、「如何に内侍共は何事の列參ぞ。」「徳大寺殿の御參候うて七日こもらせ給ひて御上り候を一日路送り参せて候へば、さりとては餘りに、名殘の惜きに、今一日路二日路と仰られて、是まで召具せられて候ふ。」「徳大寺は何事の祈誓に、嚴島までは參られたりけるやらん。」との給へば、「大將の御祈の爲とこそ仰られ候ひしか。」,"The Priest-Regent hurriedly met them: ""Why do these attendants make formal visits?"" They explained, ""After escorting Tokudaiji for a day's journey upon his seven-day seclusion departure—and being summoned further due to lingering attachment—we now come."" When asked about the Itsukushima visit, they replied it was for prayers. The Regent sighed, ""Ah! It was all to pray for my position as Great General."""
27,37,其時入道打うなづいて、「あないとほし、王城にさしも尊き靈佛靈社の幾も御座を指置て、我が崇め奉る御神へ參て祈申されけるこそありがたけれ。是程志切ならむ上は。」,"The Regent sighed deeply: ""Alas, to think I must visit even the most revered shrines of the capital to pray at my own beloved deity's shrine! Such devotion is rare indeed."""
27,38,とて、嫡子小松殿内大臣の左大將にてましましけるを辭せさせ奉り、次男宗盛大納言の右大將にて御座けるを超させて、徳大寺を左大將にぞ成されける。,"He then dismissed his legitimate son, the Minister of the Interior with the Left Great General title, and bypassed Munemori-kyō, the Second Son and Right Great General, appointing Tokudaiji to the Left Great General position."
27,39,あはれ目出度かりける策かな。,"""How wondrous yet lamentable this turn of events!"""
27,40,新大納言も、か様に賢き計らひをばし給はで、由なき謀反おこいて、我身も滅び、子息所從に至るまで、かゝる憂目を見せ給ふこそうたてかりけれ。,"Had the New Grand Councilor known this wise plan would lead to base treachery, causing his own ruin and that of his family and retainers, he surely would have wept at the thought."
28,0,さる程に、法皇は三井寺の公顯僧正を御師範として、眞言の祕法を傳受せさせましけるが、大日経、金剛頂經、蘇悉地経、此三部の祕法を受させ給ひて、九月四日、三井寺にて御灌頂有るべしとぞ聞えける。,"Indeed, the Retired Emperor had Master Kōen Shōjō of Mii-dera serve as his preceptor to transmit the esoteric teachings of Shingon. Having received the three secret teachings—the Dainichikyō (Great Sun Sutra), Kongōchōkyō (Diamond Crown Sutra), and Susushikiji (Sūratattvasamuccaya)—he was informed that an imperial initiation ceremony would be held at Mii-dera on September 4th."
28,1,山門の大衆憤申、「昔より御灌頂御受戒、皆當山にして遂させまします事先規也。就中に山王の化導は、受戒灌頂の爲なり。然るを今三井寺にて遂させましまさば、寺を向け燒拂ふべし。」とぞ申ける。,"The assembly of Enryaku-ji Mountain exclaimed indignantly: 'Ever since antiquity, the imperial initiation and ordination have been conducted solely on this mountain. Especially for the conversion of Mount Hiei itself, it is meant to be performed here. If now it is held at Mii-dera, we shall burn down the temple.'"
28,2,是無益なりとて、御加行を結願しておぼしめし留らせ給ひぬ。,"Seeing this as futile, he was instructed to conclude the preparatory rituals and halt further proceedings."
28,3,さりながらも猶本意なればとて、三井寺の公顯僧正を召具して、天王寺へ御幸なて、御智光院を建て、龜井の水を五瓶の智水として、佛法最初の靈地にてぞ、傳法灌頂は遂させましましける。,"Nevertheless, as he still held to his original intent, he summoned Master Kōen Shōjō of Mii-dera and proceeded to Tennōji Temple. There, he had the Chikō-in Hall constructed, designating the water from Kamei Well as 'five bottles of wisdom water,' and ultimately conducted the transmission initiation ceremony at the sacred site where Buddhism first took root."
28,4,山門の騒動を靜られんが爲に、三井寺にて御灌頂は無りしか共、山上には堂衆學生、不快の事出來て、合戦度々に及ぶ。,"Though the initiation was not held at Mii-dera to quell the disturbance on Mount Hiei, conflicts continued. Within the mountain's temple precincts, students of the Dharma Hall caused unrest, leading to repeated battles."
28,5,毎度に學侶打落されて山門の滅亡、朝家の御大事とぞ見えし。,"Each time the students were defeated, it appeared as a grave matter threatening the extinction of the mountain gate and the imperial court."
28,6,堂衆と申は、學生の所從なりける童部が法師に成たるや、若は中間法師原にてありけるが、金剛壽院の座主、覺尋權僧正治山の時より、三塔に結番して、夏衆と號して、佛に花進せし者共也。,"The Dharma Hall officials were originally attendants who became monks. Some had served as middle-ranking clerics under the original head priest Kakushin, who during his tenure at Kongōjū-in Monastery organized three pagodas into summer assemblies (Natsuzō) responsible for offering flowers to the Buddha."
28,7,近年行人とて、大衆をも事共せざりしが、かく度々の軍に打勝ぬ。,"In recent years, foot soldiers have disregarded the majority's authority and repeatedly been defeated in battle."
28,8,堂衆等師主の命を背いて、合戦を企つ、速に誅罰せらるべき由、大衆公家に奏聞し、武家へ觸訴ふ。,"The Dharma Hall officials, having rebelled against their spiritual master's orders and plotted battles, were reported to the court for swift punishment, with military families being petitioned accordingly."
28,9,これに依て太政入道院宣を承り、紀伊國の住人、湯淺權守宗重以下、畿内の兵二千餘騎、大衆に指,"Upon receiving the imperial decree from Tōdai-in Retired Emperor, Yūya Sōshige, the deputy governor of Kii Province, along with over 2,000 troops from the capital region, mobilized against them."
28,10,添て、堂衆を攻ら。,and attacked the Dharma Hall officials.
28,11,堂衆日來は東陽坊にありしが、近江の國三箇の庄に下向して、數多の勢を率し、又登山して、早尾坂に城をして立籠る。,"The Dharma Hall officials, who had long resided at Tōyōbō, descended to three estates in Ōmi Province, mobilized a large force, then ascended the mountain and fortified themselves with a castle on Hayabara Slope."
28,12,同九月廿日、辰の一點に大衆三千人、官軍二千餘騎、都合其勢五千餘人、早尾坂に押よせたり。,"On the same September 20th, at the first hour of the Dragon (around 7-9 AM), 3,000 rebels and over 2,000 imperial troops—totaling nearly 5,000 men—advanced upon Hayabara Slope."
28,13,今度はさり共と思ひけるに、大衆は官軍を先立てんとし、官軍は又大衆を先立てんと爭ふ程に心心にて、はか％＼しうも戰はず。,"Though both sides intended to strike first, their mutual hesitation led to no engagement taking place."
28,14,城の内より石弓弛懸たりければ、大衆官軍數を盡て討れにけり。,"Had the castle released its stones and arrows, it could have annihilated both rebel and imperial forces."
28,15,堂衆に語ふ惡黨と云は、諸国の竊盗、強盗、山賊、海賊等也。,"Those called 'ruffians' by the Dharma Hall officials included thieves, bandits, mountain pirates, and sea raiders from various provinces."
28,16,欲心熾盛にして、死生不知の奴原なれば、我一人と思切て戰ふ程に、今度も又學生軍に負にけり。,"Driven by insatiable greed and reckless disregard for life, they fought as if each were alone, but once again the student army prevailed."
29,0,其後は山門彌荒はてゝ、十二禪衆の外は、止住の僧侶も稀なり、谷々の講演磨滅して、堂堂の行法も退轉す。,"Afterwards, the monastic community grew increasingly desolate; apart from the twelve Zen assemblies, even resident monks became scarce. The lectures in the valleys faded away, and the grand religious practices declined."
29,1,修學の窓を閉ぢ、坐禪の床を空うせり。,"The windows of learning were shut, and the meditation platform left vacant."
29,2,四教五時の春の花も香はず、三諦即是の秋の月も曇れり。,The spring blossoms of the Four Teachings and Five Periods no longer emit fragrance; the autumn moon of the Three Truths being identical is veiled by clouds.
29,3,三百餘歳の法燈を挑る人もなく、六時不斷の香の煙も、絶やしぬらん。,No one now carries the lamp of a three-hundred-year-old Dharma; even the incense smoke that once billowed unceasingly through six periods has vanished.
29,4,堂舎高く聳えて、三重の構を青漢の内に挿み、棟梁遙に秀て、四面の椽を白霧の間に懸たりき。,"The halls towered high, their triple-tiered frameworks piercing the azure heavens. The ridgepoles stood out proudly, suspending the eaves between layers of white mist."
29,5,され共今は供佛を嶺の嵐に任せ、金容を紅瀝に濡す。,"Now, however, offerings to the Buddha are left to mountain storms, and golden countenances drenched by crimson rain."
29,6,夜の月燈を挑て檐の隙より漏り、曉の露珠を垂れて蓮座の粧を添いかや。,"Night’s moon-lanterns drip through eave cracks, while morning dewdrops adorn the makeup of lotus thrones."
29,7,夫末代の俗に至ては、三國の佛法も次第に衰微せり。,"When it came to later generations’ customs, even Buddhism in the three realms gradually declined."
29,8,遠く天竺に佛跡を弔へば、昔佛の法を説給ひし竹林精舎、給孤獨園も此比は狐狼野干の栖と成て、礎のみや殘るらん。,"Traveling afar to India’s sacred sites, even the Bamboo Grove Monastery where the Buddha once taught and Jeta Garden now become lairs for foxes, wolves, and jackals—only their foundations remain."
29,9,白鷺池には水絶て、草のみ深くしげれり。,"In the White Egret Pond, water has dried up; only weeds grow deep and thick."
29,10,退梵下乘,"Declining Dharma, inferior vehicle"
29,11,の卒都婆も苔のみむして傾きぬ。,"Even its stream-enterers, overgrown with moss, refuse to collapse."
29,12,震旦にも天台山、五臺山、白馬寺、玉泉寺も、今は住侶なく様々に荒果て、大小乘の法門も、箱の底にや朽ぬらん。,"In China too, Tiantai, Wutai Mountains,白马 Temple, and Yuchi Temple now lie desolate without resident monks. Great and small vehicle Dharma gates have rotted away like objects in a trunk’s bottom."
29,13,我朝にも南都七大寺荒果て、八宗九宗も跡絶え、愛宕高雄も昔は堂塔軒を竝たりしか共、一夜の中に荒にしかば、天狗の栖と成り果てぬ。,"In our land, too, Nanto’s seven great temples lie ruined; eight and nine schools have vanished without trace. Mount Atago and Takao—once adorned with halls, pagodas, and eaves—were reduced to wilderness overnight, becoming abodes of tengu demons."
29,14,さればにや、さしも止事無りつる天台の佛法も、治承の今に及で、亡果ぬるにやと、心有る人歎悲まずと云事なし。,"Thus, even the Tendai Dharma that had long been dormant—would it not perish by now in the Jisho era? A person of heart cannot help but lament this."
29,15,離山しける僧の坊の柱に、歌をぞ一首書いたりける。,"On the pillar of a monk’s retreat far from mountains, there was written a single poem:"
29,16,祈りこし我立杣のひきかへて、人なき嶺となりや果なん。,Prayers long past returned my mountain path to its source—has this ridge become a place of no people at last?
29,17,是は傳教大師、當山草創の昔、阿耨多羅三藐三菩提の佛たちに、祈申されける事を、思ひ出て詠たりけるにや。,"This is said to be a poem composed by Dengyo Daishi, recalling his prayers to the Thus Come Ones—the Buddha of Perfect Enlightenment—when he first founded this mountain."
29,18,いと優うぞ聞えし。,"Truly, how moving it sounds!"
29,19,八日は藥師の日なれども、南無と唱る聲もせず。,"Though the eighth day is the Medicine Buddha’s day, no ‘Namu’ chants are heard."
29,20,卯月は垂跡の月なれ共幣帛を捧る人もなし。,"Even though Uzuki (June) is the month of offerings to ancestral spirits, no one brings ceremonial gifts."
29,21,朱の玉垣神さびて、しめ繩のみや殘るらん。,The vermilion stone walls of shrines decay; only ritual straw ropes remain.
30,0,其比善光寺炎上の由其聞あり。,"Regarding the burning of Higashiyama Gokuraku-ji, this matter has been passed down."
30,1,彼如來と申は昔天竺舎衞國に、五種の惡病起て、人多く滅しに月蓋長者が致請に依て、龍宮城より閻浮檀金を得て、釋尊、目連、長者心を一にして、鑄現し給へる一ちやく手半の彌陀の三尊、閻浮提第一の靈像なり。,"That Buddha, as it is said, originated in ancient Śravasti of India. When five grave diseases arose and decimated the people, the elder Moon-Cover (Gakkai) made a fervent plea. From the Dragon Palace he obtained Jambu-tan gold, and together with Shaka Nyorai, Mokuren Bosatsu, and the elder's unified intent, he cast a single statue: half a chalice-sized Amitabha Triad, the most sacred image in Jambudvīpa."
30,2,ちやく手半の彌陀の三尊、閻浮提第一の靈像なり。,This half-chalice-sized Amitabha Triad is the foremost spiritual icon of Jambudvīpa.
30,3,佛滅度の後、天竺に留らせ給ふ事、五百餘歳、佛法東漸の理にて、百濟国に移らせ給ひて、一千歳の後、百濟の帝齊明王、我朝の帝欽明天皇の御宇に及で、彼國より此國へ移らせ給ひて、攝津国難波の浦にして、星霜を送らせ給ひけり。,"After the Buddha's parinirvana, it remained in India for over five centuries. In accordance with the propagation of佛法 (Dharma), it was relocated to Baekje after a thousand years. When King Seimei of Baekje and Emperor Kinmei of our land reigned concurrently, it was brought from there to this country and enshrined at Naniwa Harbor in Settsu Province, where it weathered the passage of time."
30,4,常は金色の光を放たせましましければ、是に依て年號を、金光と號す。,"Since this image continuously radiated golden light, the era was named Kinshō (Golden Light) accordingly."
30,5,同三年三月上旬に信濃國の住人、麻績の本太善光と云者都へ上りたりけるに、彼如來に逢奉りたりけるに、軈ていざなひ參せて、晝は善光、如來を負奉り、夜は善光、如来に負はれ奉て、信濃國へ下り、水内郡に安置し奉しよりこのかた、星霜既に五百八十餘歳、炎上の例は是始とぞ承る。,"In the third year of that era, during the early days of March, a man named Mōme no Honnō Taigen Shinkō from Shinano Province ascended to the capital. Having paid homage to that Buddha statue, he was miraculously summoned three times: by day, Shinkō carried the image; by night, the image bore him aloft. Thus it descended back to Shinano and was enshrined in Suina District. For five hundred eighty years thereafter, this had been its abode—until now, when the precedent of its burning has come to pass."
30,6,「王法盡んとては、佛法先亡ず。」といへり。,"It is said, 'When secular law perishes, Buddhism shall perish first.'"
30,7,さればにや、さしも止事なかりつる靈山の多く滅失ぬるは、王法の末に成ぬる先表やらんとぞ申ける。,"Therefore, the wholesale destruction of even sacred mountains in these declining times must be seen as an omen preceding the collapse of secular governance."
31,0,さる程に鬼界が島の流人共、露の命草葉の末に懸て、惜むべきとには有ね共、丹波少將の舅平宰相教盛の領、肥前国鹿瀬の庄より、衣食を常に送られければ、其にてぞ俊寛僧都も康頼も命を生て過しける。,"Indeed, the exiles on Onigashima—their lives hanging like dew on grass tips—though there was no reason to lament, due to provisions of food and clothing sent from Kase no sho in Hizen Province (the domain of Danba Shoujou's uncle, Hira Sosho Kyomori), Junsen Sozu and Yasuyori were able to sustain their lives."
31,1,康頼は、流されける時、周防の室つみにて出家してけり。,"When Yasuyori was exiled, he became a monk at the residence of Shuufuu in Suo Province."
31,2,法名は性照とこそ附たりけれ。,To him was given the Buddhist name Sesso.
31,3,出家は本よりの望なりければ、つひにかくそむきはてける世の中を、とくすてざりし事ぞくやしき。,"Since his ordination was his own true desire, even this world of hardship and disgrace could not deter him from abandoning it."
31,4,丹波少將、康頼入道は、本より熊野信心の人なれば、如何にもして此島の内に熊野三所権現を勧請し奉て歸洛の事を祈申さばやと云に、僧都は天性不信第一の人にて是を用ゐず。,"As Danba Shoujou and Priest Yasuyori were sincere devotees of Kumano, they sought to enshrine the Three Kumano Deities within this island and pray for their return to Kyoto. However, Sozu Junsen—who by nature was utterly irreligious—did not heed this."
31,5,二人は同じ心に、若熊野に似たる所やあると、島の内を尋廻るに、或は林塘の妙なる有り、紅錦繍の粧品々に、或は雲嶺の恠あり、碧羅綾の色一つに非ず。,"The two shared the resolve that if there were places resembling Kumano within the island, they would traverse it. Indeed, there were wondrous sights: crimson brocade-like forests, mystical cloud peaks, and hues not unlike blue silk."
31,6,山の景色樹の木立に至る迄、外よりも猶勝れたり。,Even the mountain scenery and dense tree stands surpassed what lay beyond.
31,7,南を望めば、海漫々として、雲の波煙の浪深く、北を顧れば、,"Gazing southward, the sea stretched endlessly with waves like smoke; looking north, there were—"
31,8,又山岳の峨々たるより、百尺の瀧水漲落たり。,lofty mountains from which a hundred-foot waterfall surged and ebbed.
31,9,瀧の音殊に凄じく、松風神さびたる栖、飛瀧権現の御座す那智の御山にもさも似たりけり。,"The falls' roar was especially dreadful, resembling the sacred abode of Taki Gongen at Nachi-no-yama (where the deity resides amidst pine winds and solitude)."
31,10,さてこそ、やがてそこをば那智の御山とは名附けれ。,"Thus, that place came to be called Nachi-no-yama."
31,11,此嶺は本宮、彼は新宮、是はそんぢやう其王子、彼王子など、王子々々の名を申て、康頼入道先達にて、丹波少將相具しつゝ、日ごとに熊野詣の眞似、歸洛の事をぞ祈ける。,"They named this peak 'Honmiya' (Main Shrine), that 'Shinmiya' (New Shrine), and so on, after the various shrines of Kumano. Under Priest Yasuyori's guidance, Danba Shoujou faithfully performed daily rituals mimicking a pilgrimage to Kumano, praying for their return to Kyoto."
31,12,「南無權現金剛童子、願は憐を垂させ御座して、故郷へかへし入させ給へ、妻子共をも今一度見せ給へ。」とぞ祈ける。,"""Namu Kongo Kodōshi (Hail to the Diamond Child Deity), we humbly beseech you: grant us mercy and allow us to return home, to once more behold our wives and children."" Thus they prayed."
31,13,日數積りて、裁更べき淨衣も無ければ、麻の衣を身に纏ひ、澤邊の水をこりにかいては、岩田川の清き流と思やり、高所に上ては、発心門とぞ観じける。,"As days passed and pure ritual garments became scarce, they clothed themselves in hemp. By the marsh's edge, they imagined it as the clear flow of Iwata River; ascending heights, they gazed upon the 'Gate of Enlightenment.'"
31,14,参る度毎には康頼入道、祝言を申に、御幣紙も無ければ、花を手折て捧つつ、とぞ康頼祝言をば申ける。,"On each pilgrimage, Priest Yasuyori recited blessings: lacking paper for offerings, he plucked flowers with his own hands and presented them, thus fulfilling the rites."
32,0,丹波少將、康頼入道、常は三所權現の御前に参て、通夜する折も有けり。,"Danba Shōshō, Kōrai Indou; even when they attended the three shrine's presence for vigils, there was such a time."
32,1,或時二人通夜して、夜もすがら今様をぞ歌ひける。,"Sometimes these two held vigils together, singing contemporary verses all through the night."
32,2,晓方に康頼入道、ちと目睡たる夢に、沖より白い帆掛たる小舟を一艘漕寄て、舟の中より紅の袴きたる女房、二三十人あがり、皷を打ち聲を調て、萬の佛の願よりも、千手の誓ぞたのもしき、枯れたる草木も忽に、花さき實なるとこそきけ。,"At dawn, Kōrai Indou had a half-dream: from the open sea came one small boat with white sails rowed close. From it rose two dozen women in crimson hakama, beating drums and tuning their voices—'More faithful than ten thousand Buddhas' vows, 'even withered grasses bloom suddenly, bear fruit!' they sang."
32,3,と三辺歌澄して、掻けす様にぞ失にける。,"The three-part chorus resonated clearly, then vanished like a scattering of cherry petals."
32,4,夢覚て後、奇異の思をなし、康頼入道申せは、「是は龍神の化現と覺えたり。三所權現のうちに、西の御前と申は、本地千手觀音にておはします。龍神は則千手の廿八部衆の其一なれば、もて御納受こそ頼敷けれ。」又或夜二人通夜して同じう目睡たりける夢に、沖より吹くる風の、二人が袂に木の葉を二つ吹懸たりけるを、何となう取て見ければ、御熊野の南木の葉にてぞ有ける。,"After waking, Kōrai pondered this marvel: 'I believe this was the dragon deity's manifestation. Among the Three Shrine Lords, the Western Presence embodies the Thousand-Armed Bodhisattva. The dragon king is one of the Twenty-Eight Retainers—pray accept our offerings.' Another night they dreamed again: a wind from the sea blew two leaves onto their sleeves; upon inspection, these proved to be sacred nanten leaves from Kumano's southern groves."
32,5,かの二の南木の葉に一首の歌を蟲くひにこそしたりけれ。,"Upon those twin sacred leaves, a single poem had been etched by insect spirits."
32,6,ちはやぶる神にいのりの繁ければ、などか都へ歸らざるべき。,"If the gods' blessings multiply so richly, why should I not return to Kyoto?"
32,7,康頼入道、故郷の戀しきまゝに、せめてのはかりごとに、千本の卒都婆を作り、,"Driven by homesickness, Kōrai Indou carved a thousand sutodoba (prayer sticks),"
32,8,あ字の梵字、年號月日、假名、實名、二首の歌をぞ書たりける。,"inscribing each with Sanskrit syllables, reign dates, phonetic characters, true names, and two verses:"
32,9,薩摩潟沖の小島に我ありと、親には告よ八重の汐風。,On a tiny island in the Satsuma Bay lies my abode—tell my parents through the eightfold tides.
32,10,思ひやれしばしと思ふ旅だにも、猶ふるさとはこひしき物を。,"Even in brief travels, the beloved homeland remains my heart's treasure."
32,11,是を浦に持て出て、「南無歸命頂禮、梵天帝釋、四大天王、けんろう地神、王城の鎭守諸大明神、殊には熊野權現、嚴島大明神、せめては一本なり共、都へ傳てたべ。」とて、沖つ白波の、よせては歸る度毎に、卒都婆を海にぞ浮べける。,"He took them to the harbor, praying: 'Homage to all deities—Brahma, Śakra, Four Kings... especially Kumano and Itsukushima Shrines. Let these thousand sticks convey my faith to Kyoto.' Each time the white waves calmed, he floated a sutodoba toward the sea."
32,12,卒都婆を造出すに隨て、海に入れければ、日數の積れば、卒都婆の数もつもりけり。,"For each stick cast into the sea, days passed accordingly—"
32,13,その思ふ心や便の風とも成たりけむ。,His yearning became wind and weather itself.
32,14,又神明佛陀もや送らせ給ひけむ。,And the deities Buddha too sent their blessings.
32,15,千本の卒都婆のなかに、一本、安藝國嚴島の大明神の御前の渚に打あ,"Among the thousand sticks, one reached the shore"
32,16,げたり。,before the Great Shrine of Itsukushima in Aki Province.
32,17,こゝに康頼入道がゆかりありける僧、然るべき便もあらば、如何にもして彼島へ渡て、其行へを聞むとて、西國修行に出たりけるが、先嚴島へぞ參りたりける。,"A monk connected to Kōrai Indou, upon hearing this, embarked on a pilgrimage westward. His first destination was Itsukushima."
32,18,爰に宮人とおぼしくて、狩衣裝束なる俗、一人出來たり。,"There he encountered a layman dressed as a courtier, appearing like an imperial retainer."
32,19,此僧何となき物語しけるに、「夫和光同塵の利生、様々なりと申せども、如何なりける因縁を以て、此御神は海漫の鱗に縁をば結ばせ給ふらん。」と問奉る。,"The monk asked, 'In teachings of harmonizing with the world, there are many paths. What particular vow binds this deity to oceanic scales?'"
32,20,宮人答けるは、「是はよな、娑竭羅龍王の第三の姫宮、胎藏界の垂跡也。」此島へ御影向有し始より濟度利生の今に至るまで、甚深奇特の事共をぞ語ける。,"The courtier replied, 'Indeed—the Third Daughter of Ryūjin, manifesting as the Vajradhātu Mandala. Since her divine presence first graced this island until now in salvation work, countless wondrous deeds have been wrought.'"
32,21,さればにや、八社の御殿甍を竝べ、社はわたつみの邊なれば、汐の滿乾に月ぞすむ。,"Therefore, the eight shrine roofs gleam together; being near the sea, they reflect moonlight through tides' ebb and flow."
32,22,汐滿くれば、大鳥居緋の玉垣瑠璃の如し。,"At high tide, the great torii gate resembles crimson-jeweled glass."
32,23,汐引ぬれば夏の夜なれど、御前の白洲に霜ぞおく。,Low tide brings summer nights' frost upon the deity's white shore.
32,24,いよ／＼尊く覺て、法施參せて居たりけるに、漸々日暮月指いでて、汐の滿けるが、そこはかとなき、藻くづ共のゆられける中に、卒都婆の形の見えけるを、何となう取て見ければ、沖の小島に我ありと、書流せる言葉也。,"As he meditated on Buddhist charity, dusk approached. At high tide amidst seaweed swaying, he noticed a stick shape—upon inspection, it bore the words: 'On a distant offshore island lies my home.'"
32,25,文字をば彫入刻附たりければ、波にも洗はれず、あざあざとしてぞ見えける。,"The characters, carved deeply, remained undisturbed by waves and gleamed freshly."
32,26,「あな、不思議。」とて、是を笈のかたにさし、都へ上り、康頼が老婆の尼公妻子共が、一條の北、紫野と云處に忍つゝ住けるに、見せたりければ、「さらば此卒都婆が唐の方へもゆられ行かで、なにしに是迄傳ひ來て、今更物を思はすらん。」とぞ悲みける。,"'Marvelous!' He placed it in his pack and journeyed to Kyoto. Showing it to Kōrai's wife and mother-in-law hiding in Shinyo north of the capital, they wept: 'Why has this stick traveled all the way here? Did it not need to reach China first?'"
32,27,遙の叡聞に及で、法皇之を御覽じて、「あな無慚や、さればいまだこの者共は命の生て有にこそ。」と、御涙を流させ給ふぞ忝き。,"When the retired emperor heard this, he wept: 'Shame! These people still live when they should have perished.'"
32,28,小松の大臣の許へ送らせ給ひたりければ、是を父の入道相國に見せ奉り給ふ。,"Ordered to the Lord of Komatsu, it was presented to his father, the cloistered regent."
32,29,柿本人,Kakitsubata (a type of iris)
32,30,丸は、島がくれ行舟を思ひ、山邊赤人は、蘆邊の田鶴をながめ給ふ。,"The round leaves yearned for departing ships, while the red-tailed sparrows watched herons by reeds."
32,31,住吉明神は、かたそぎの思をなし、三輪明神は、杉立る門をさす。,"Sumiyoshi Shrine held lingering thoughts, while Miwa Shrine pointed to cedar gates."
32,32,昔素盞嗚尊、三十一字の和歌を始めおき給しより以來、諸の神明佛陀も、彼詠吟を以て、百千萬端の思を述給ふ。,"Since Susanoo composed the first 31-syllable poem, all deities and Buddhas have expressed their myriad thoughts through verse."
32,33,入道も岩木ならねば、さすが哀げにぞ宣ひける。,"Even the indou monk would have lamented, had he been a rock or tree."
33,0,入道相國の憐み給ふ上は、京中の上下、老たるも若きも、鬼界が島の流人の歌とて、口ずさまぬは無りけり。,"Because the priest-statesman (Kiyomori) showed compassion, throughout Kyoto from high to low, both old and young, there was none who did not hum the songs of exiles from Ghost Island."
33,1,さても千本迄造り出せる卒都婆なれば、さこそは小さうも有けめ。,"Even if they had produced arrowheads as far as Senbon (a place name), still there would have been some small ones lacking."
33,2,薩摩潟より遙々と、都まで傳はりけるこそ不思議なれ。,That the song from Sakuma Bay should have reached so far as the capital is truly strange.
33,3,餘に思ふ事はかく驗有にや。,"As for other matters to ponder, they are thus verified by evidence."
33,4,古漢王胡國を攻られけるに、始は李少卿を大將軍にて、三十萬騎むけられたりけるが、漢王の軍弱く、胡國の戰強して、官軍皆討ち滅さる。,"When ancient Han Emperor attacked Hu State, first appointing General Li Shaosin with 300,000 troops – yet the Han army was weak while Hu's fighting grew strong, annihilating all imperial forces."
33,5,剩へ大將軍李少卿、胡王のために生擒らる。,Even the remaining General Li Shaosin was captured alive by Hu King.
33,6,次に蘇武を大將軍にて、五十萬騎を向けらる。,"Next they appointed General Su Wu with 500,000 troops."
33,7,猶漢の軍弱く夷の戰強して官軍皆滅にけり。,"Still the Han army was weak while the barbarian fighting grew strong, annihilating all imperial forces."
33,8,兵六千餘人生擒らる。,Six thousand soldiers were captured alive.
33,9,其中に大將軍蘇武を始として、宗との兵六百三十餘人、勝出し一々に片足を切て、追放つ。,"Among them, General Su Wu first led 630 men from his clan. Each cut off one foot and was exiled."
33,10,即死する者もあり、程へて死ぬる者もあり。,"Some died immediately, others perished later."
33,11,其中にされ共蘇武は死ざりけり。,"Yet among them all, Su Wu did not die."
33,12,片足なき身となて、山に上ては木の實を拾ひ、春は澤の根芹をつみ、秋は田面の落穗を拾ひなどして露の命を過しけり。,"With one leg gone, he climbed mountains gathering nuts, in spring dug riverbank parsley roots, in autumn collected fallen grains – thus spent his transient life."
33,13,田にいくらもありける鴈ども、蘇武に見馴て恐ざりければ、是等は皆我故郷へ通ふ者ぞかしと懷しさに、思ふ事を一筆書て、「相構て是漢王,"Geese that had grown familiar to Su Wu in the fields, not fearing him, he thought: 'These are surely messengers to our homeland.' With pensive heart wrote a missive: 'Inform His Majesty the Han Emperor"
33,14,に上れ。,:'
33,15,」と云含め、鴈の翅に結つけてぞ放ける。,' binding it to a goose's wing and loosed them.
33,16,かひ％＼しくも田面の鴈、秋は必ずこしぢより都へ通ふものなるに、漢の昭帝上林苑に御遊ありしに、夕されの空うす曇り、なにとなう物哀なりけるをりふし、一行の鴈飛渡る。,"Though geese from fields indeed fly to the capital each autumn, when Emperor Zhao of Han was hunting in Shanglin Garden that evening under hazy twilight – what wondrous pitying spectacle! A flock of geese crossed the sky."
33,17,其中より鴈一つ飛さがて、己が翅に結附たる玉章をくひ切てぞ落しける。,"One goose turned back, gnawing off the jade scroll tied to its wing and dropping it."
33,18,官人これを取て、御門に上る。,An official retrieved it and presented it at court gate.
33,19,披て叡覽あれば、「昔は巖窟の洞に籠られて、三春の愁歎を送り、今は昿田の畝に捨られて、胡狄の一足となれり。縱骸は胡の地に散すと云とも、魂は二度君邊に仕へん。」とぞ書たりける。,"When unfolded and read: 'Once confined in rocky caves, spent three springs' lamentation; now cast into barren fields, become Hu barbarian with one foot. Though body scatters in foreign earth, soul will serve Your Majesty twice more.'"
33,20,其よりしてぞ文をば鴈書ともいひ、鴈札とも名付たる。,Henceforth such writings were called 'goose letters' or 'feather missives'.
33,21,「あな無慚や蘇武が譽の跡なりけり。未胡國にあるにこそ。」とて、今度は李廣と云將軍に仰て、百萬騎を差遣す。,"'Ah, what shame! Let this honor Su Wu's memory. Since he remains in Hu land,' they ordered General Li Guang to dispatch 1,000,000 troops."
33,22,今度は漢の戰強くして、胡國の軍破れにけり。,This time Han's forces grew strong and shattered Hu army.
33,23,御方戰勝ぬと聞えしかば、蘇武は昿野の中より這出て、「是こそ古の蘇武よ。」と名乘る。,"When word reached court of victory, Su Wu crawled from desolate fields: 'I am the old General Su Wu!'"
33,24,十九年의星霜を送て、片足は切れながら、輿に舁れて、故郷へぞ歸りける。,"After nineteen years' vicissitudes, with one leg severed, carried in litter – returned home."
33,25,蘇武十六の歳より胡國へ向けられけるに、御門より賜りたりける旗をば何としてかかくしたりけん、身を放たず持たりけり。,"Since sent to Hu at sixteen, the banner bestowed by court he never unfurled but kept close."
33,26,今取出して御門の見參に入りければ、君も臣も感嘆斜ならず。,"Now displayed in audience before throne, moved neither sovereign nor minister."
33,27,君の爲大功雙無りしかば、大國數多賜り、其上典屬国と云司を下されけるとぞ聞えし。,"For unparalleled service, granted many fiefdoms; moreover established a new office called 'Director of Loyalty'."
33,28,李少卿は、胡國に留て、終に歸らず。,"General Li Shaosin remained in Hu land, never returning."
33,29,如何にもして漢朝へ歸らんとのみ歎けども、胡王許さねば叶はず。,"Though he lamented return to Han court, Hu king would not permit it."
33,30,漢王是をば知り給はず、君の爲に不忠の者なりとて、はかんなれる二親の骸を掘起して打せらる。,"Unaware, Han Emperor deemed him disloyal – had both parents' bones exhumed and crushed."
33,31,其外六親を皆罪せらる。,All six collateral relatives likewise punished.
33,32,李少卿此由を傳聞いて、恨深うぞ成にける。,"Learning this, Li Shaosin's resentment grew profound."
33,33,さりながら猶故郷を戀つゝ、君に不忠なき樣を一卷の書に作て參らせたりければ、「さては,"Yet still longing for homeland, he composed a scroll demonstrating unwavering loyalty to be presented: 'Thus"
33,34,不愍の事ごさんなれ。,:'
33,35,」とて、父母が骸を掘いだいて打せられたる事をぞ、悔しみ給ひける。,' lamenting the desecration of his parents' remains.
33,36,漢家の蘇武は、書を鴈の翅に附て舊里へ送り、本朝の康頼は、浪の便に歌を故郷に傳ふ。,"Han's Su Wu sent missives via goose, while our Masu Kaneyori transmitted songs through ocean tides."
33,37,彼は一筆のすさみ、是は二首の歌、彼は上代、是は末代、胡國、鬼界が島、境を隔て、世々は替れども、風情は同じ風情。,"One scroll's ink, two verses' song – ancient and modern, Hu land and Ghost Island, though separated by realms, shared same poetic spirit."
33,38,ありがたかりし事ども也。,Truly wondrous things indeed.
34,0,治承二年正月一日、院御所には拜禮行はれて、四日の日朝覲の行幸在けり。,"On the first day of the first month, Year Two of Shōryaku (1180), ceremonies were held at the Retired Emperor's residence. On the fourth day, an imperial procession attended morning audience."
34,1,何事も例にかはりたる事は無れ共、去年の夏新大納言成親卿以下、近習の人々多く失れし事、法皇御憤未止ず、世の政も懶く思召されて、御心よからぬ事にてぞ在ける。,"Though no precedent existed, the sudden loss last summer of Shin Dainagon Sanenori and his retainers continued to anger the Retired Emperor. State affairs were neglected, and His Majesty's heart was troubled beyond remedy."
34,2,太政入道も、多田藏人行綱が告知せて後は、君をも御後めたき事に思ひ奉て、上には事なき樣なれ共、下には用心して、苦笑てのみぞ在ける。,"The Regent, after receiving word from Takada Kanetsuna's report, resolved to shelter the sovereign. Though appearing composed above, secretly below he worried and wore a forced smile."
34,3,同正月七日彗星東方に出づ。,"On the seventh day of the same month's first lunar cycle, a comet appeared in the eastern sky."

34,6,十八日光を増す。,"On the eighteenth day, its brilliance intensified."
34,7,去程に入道相国の御女建禮門院、其比は未中宮と聞えさせ給しが、御惱とて、雲の上、天が下の歎にてぞ在ける。,"In previous days, the Regent's daughter Kenrei-mon-in (formerly Middle Empress) lay gravely ill, her condition lamented as a celestial plague."
34,8,諸寺に御讀経始り、諸社へ官幣使を立らる、醫家藥を盡し、陰陽術を窮め、大法秘法一つとして殘る所なう修せられけり。,"Temples began imperial-sponsored sutra recitations. Shrines dispatched court officials for rituals. All medical remedies were exhausted, all divinations performed—esoteric Buddhist rites alone remained."
34,9,され共、御惱たゞにも渡せ給はず、御懷姙とぞ聞えし。,Yet her suffering persisted. The court learned of the Empress Dowager's grave illness.
34,10,主上今年十八、中宮は二十二に成せ給ふ。,"The sovereign was eighteen this year; the Empress, twenty-two."
34,11,然共、未皇子も姫宮も出來させ給はず。,"Still, no prince or princess had been born to them."
34,12,若皇子にてわたらせ給はば、如何に目出度からんと、平家の人々は唯今皇子御誕生の有様に、勇悦びあはれけり。,"Should a prince be born, what splendor! The Taira rejoiced beyond measure at the prospect of imperial birth."
34,13,他家の人々も、「平氏の御繁昌折を得たり、皇子御誕生疑なし。」,"Even others declared: 'With the Taira's flourishing, there can be no doubt of imperial birth.'"
34,14,とぞ申あはれける。,They lamented this wondrous omen.
34,15,御懷姙定らせ給しかば、有驗の高僧貴僧に仰せて、大法秘法を修し、星宿佛菩薩につけて、皇子御誕生と祈誓せらる。,"When the Empress Dowager's condition stabilized, renowned monks were summoned to perform esoteric rites invoking celestial deities for imperial birth."
34,16,六月一日、中宮御著帶有けり。,"On the first day of the sixth lunar month, the Empress underwent the ceremonial waistbanding rite."

34,18,天台の座主覺快法親王、同う參せ給て、変成男子の法を修せられけり。,"Monk-Prince Kakukai, Tendai sect head, also attended to perform the 'Transform into Male' ritual."
34,19,かゝりし程に、中宮は月の重るに隨て、御身を苦うせさせ給ふ。,"Yet as her lunar cycles progressed, the Empress grew increasingly pained."
34,20,一度笑ば百の媚有けん漢の李夫人、昭陽殿の病の床もかくやと覺え、唐の楊貴妃、梨花一枝春の雨を帶び、芙蓉の風にしをれ、女郎花の露重げなるよりも猶痛しき御樣なり。,"Like Li Fei, the Han concubine whose single smile enchanted a hundred beauties; like Yang Guifei in her illness at Zhaoyang Hall—more pained than pear blossoms weighed by spring rain, lotus flowers battered by wind, or maiden flowers drowning in dew."
34,21,かゝる御惱の折節に合せて、こはき御物怪共、取入奉る。,"During this critical juncture, strange phenomena began appearing."
34,22,よりまし明王の縛に掛て、靈顯れたり。,Even the wrathful deities' chains were seen manifesting.
34,23,殊には讃岐院の御靈、宇治惡左府の憶念、新大納言成親の死靈、西光法師が悪靈、鬼界島の流人共の生靈などぞ申ける。,"Particularly, the spirit of赞岐院 (Sanzui-in), recollections of宇治惡左府 (Uji no Azafu), the ghost of Shin Dainagon Sanenori, the malevolent spirit of West Light Priest, and the living spirits of exiles on鬼界島 (Kiheiji Island) were reported."
34,24,是によて太政入道生靈も死靈も、宥らるべしとて、其比やがて讃岐院御追号有て、崇徳天皇と號す。,Thus the Regent resolved to appease both living and dead spirits.赞岐院 was posthumously honored as Emperor Sutoku.
34,25,宇治惡左府、贈官贈位行はれて、太政大臣正一位を贈らる。,"宇治惡左府 was granted the rank of Minister of State, First Rank."
34,26,勅使は少内記惟基とぞ聞えし。,The envoy was known as Shōnagon Sukemochi.
34,27,件の墓所は、大和國添上の郡、河上の村、般若野の五三昧也。,"This grave site lay in the province of Yamato, at Gokamori (Five Samadhi) near Kawaue village."
34,28,保元の秋掘起して捨られし後は死骸道の邊の土となて、年々に只春の草のみ茂れり。,"Buried and exhumed during the autumn of Hōgen (1156), its remains became mere earth by the path. Yearly, only spring grass grew there."
34,29,今勅使尋來て、宣命を讀けるに、亡魂いかに嬉とおぼしけん。,"When the imperial envoy arrived to read the edict, the spirit must surely have rejoiced."
34,30,怨靈はかく怖ろしき事也。,How terrifying are vengeful spirits!
34,31,されば早良の廢太子をば崇道天皇と號し、井上内親王をば、皇后の職位に復す。,"Thus, the deposed Prince Sawara was posthumously honored as Emperor Sutoku. Princess Inoue was restored to empress rank."
34,32,是皆怨靈を宥められし策也。,These were all measures to placate vengeful spirits.
34,33,冷泉院の御物狂う坐し、花山の法皇十善萬乘の定位をすべらせ給しは、基方民部卿が靈とかや。,"The Retired Emperor of Reizei-in's madness, and the Monk-Emperor Kazan's loss of imperial rank—all attributed to the spirit of Minbukyō-no-Kami."
34,34,三條院の御目も御覽ぜられざりしは、寛算供奉が靈也。,
34,35,門脇宰相か樣の事共伝聞いて、小松殿に申されけるは、「中宮御産の御祈樣々に候也。何と申候とも非常の赦に過たる事有るべし共覺え候はず。中にも鬼界島の流人共召還されたらん程の功徳善根、爭か候べき。」と申されければ、小松殿父の禪門の御前に坐て、「あの丹波少將が事を宰相の強ちに歎申候が不便に候。中宮御惱の御事、承及ぶ如くんば、殊更成親卿が死靈などと聞え候。大納言が死靈を宥んと思召んにつけても、生て候少將をこそ召還され候はめ。人の念ひを休させ給はば、思召す事も叶ひ、人の願を叶へさせ給はば、御願も既成就して中宮やがて、皇子御誕生有て、家門の榮花彌盛に候べし。」など被申ければ、入道相國、日來にも似ず事の外に和いで、「さて俊寛と康頼法師が事は、如何に。」「其も同う召こそ還され候はめ。若一人も留られむは、中中罪業たるべう候。」と申されたりければ、「康頼法師が事はさる事なれ共、俊寛は隨分入道が口入を以て、人と成たる者ぞかし。其に所しもこそ多けれ、我山莊鹿谷に城廓を構へて、事にふれて、奇怪の振舞共が有けんなれば、俊寛をば思もよらず。」とぞ宣ける。,"When the Minister of the Left's affairs reached Kumagawa-no-Dainagon, who reported: 'The Empress's prayers are manifold. Though we should surely pardon all for her sake, particularly the exiles on鬼界島...,' the Regent's son, Zenmon, interjected: 'It ill becomes a minister to lament Danba Shōshō's case. If His Majesty knows of the Empress's plight and seeks to pardon Sanenori's spirit, why not recall only the living? Granting clemency would appease spirits, fulfill wishes—then when the Empress bears a prince, our family's glory will know no bounds.' The Regent, unusually conciliatory, replied: 'As for Shunkan and Kōrai... both must return. Should either remain, great misfortune awaits.' Then added: 'Kōrai's case is simple, but Shunkan—transformed by the Regent's mediation into a man of consequence—dwells in Mount Yakushi's鹿谷 (Deer Valley), where he has constructed fortifications and behaves strangely. We cannot predict his actions.'"
34,36,小松殿歸て叔父の宰相殿呼奉り、「少將は既に赦免候はんずるぞ。御心安う思召され候へ。」とのたまへば、宰相手を合てぞ悦ばれける。,"Returning to summon his uncle, the Minister of State, Kumagawa declared: 'The Shōshō is pardoned. Rest assured.' The minister clapped in joy."
34,37,「下し時もなどか申請ざらんと思ひたり気にて、教盛を見候度毎には涙を流し候しが、不便に候。」と申されければ、小松殿、「誠にさこそは思召され候らめ。子は誰とても悲ければ、能々申候はん。」とて入給ぬ。,"When told the Shōshō's mother wept every time she saw Kyomori, Kumagawa replied: 'Truly, this is why His Majesty must pardon him. A parent's grief knows no bounds.'"
34,38,去程に鬼界が島の流人共召還るべく定められて、入道相國許文下されけり。,"Thus was decreed the recall of all exiles from鬼界島, with the Regent's written consent."
34,39,御使既に都をたつ。,The imperial envoy departed Kyoto.
34,40,宰相餘の嬉さに、御使に私の使をそへてぞ下されける。,"The minister, overjoyed, sent private messengers ahead."
34,41,「夜を晝にして急ぎ下れ。」とありし,They urged: 'Hasten day and night.'
34,42,か共、心に任ぬ海路なれば、浪風を凌いで行程に、都をば七月下旬に出たれ共、長月廿日比にぞ、鬼界が島には著にける。,"Yet fearing sea dangers, they braved storms. Departing Kyoto late in the seventh month, they reached鬼界島 on the twentieth day of Chōgatsu (August)."
35,0,御使は丹左衞門尉基康と云者なり。,"The envoy was Michikata, also known as Tanzaemon-no-jō."
35,1,船より上て「是に都より流され給し丹波少將殿平判官入道殿やおはする。」と、聲々にぞ尋ける。,"From above the ship, voices repeatedly inquired, 'This must be Tamba no Shōgun, Hyuga no Kubi no Inudou, who was exiled from the capital.'"
35,2,二人の人々は、例の熊野詣して無りけり。,The two of them had not made the customary pilgrimage to Kumano.
35,3,俊寛僧都一人殘りけるが、是を聞き、「餘に思へば夢やらん、又天魔波旬の我心を誑さんとて言やらん、現共覺ぬ物かな。」とて、周章ふためき走ともなく、倒るともなく、急ぎ御使の前に走り向ひ、「何ごとぞ、是こそ京より流されたる俊寛よ。」と名乘給へば、雜色が頸に懸させたる文袋より、入道相國の許文取出して奉る。,"Jūkan, the priest, remained alone. Upon hearing this, he thought, 'Could it be a dream? Or is this the demon king of Hell trying to deceive me?' He staggered without falling, rushed to the envoy, crying out, 'What is this matter? I am Jūkan, exiled from the capital!' Then he took out a letter from a satchel hung around his neck."
35,4,披いて見れば、「重科免遠流、早可成歸洛思。依中宮御産御祈被行非常赦。然間鬼界島流人少將成経、康頼法師赦免。」と計書かれて、俊寛と云文字はなし。,"Upon opening it, they read: 'Heavy punishment and distant exile are remitted. You may return to the capital promptly. Due to an extraordinary amnesty granted for prayers for the safe birth of the Empress, Minamoto no Shigehira, the exiled Taira no Moritsuna, and the priest Kōrai have been pardoned.'"
35,5,礼紙にぞ有らんとて、禮紙を見るにも見えず。,"They expected to find a thank-you note within, but none was present."
35,6,奥より端へ讀み、端より奧へ讀けれ共、二人と計書かれて、三人とはかゝれず。,"Reading from beginning to end, and vice versa, the document was addressed to the two of them, with no mention of a third party."
35,7,さる程に少將や判官入道も出來たり、少將の取てよむにも、康頼入道が讀けるにも、二人と計かかれて、三人とはかゝれざりけり。,"Even as both read it aloud, the document clearly referred only to the two, leaving out the third man entirely."
35,8,夢にこそかゝる事は有れ、夢かと思ひなさんとすれば現也、現かと思へば又夢の如し。,"Though such things may be but a dream, if one thinks it is a dream, then it is reality; but if one considers it real, it becomes like a dream again."
35,9,其上二人の人々の許へは、都より言づけ文共、幾らも有けれ共、俊寛僧都の許へは、事問文一つもなし。,"To the two men were given numerous official documents sent from the capital, while not even a single inquiry was made to Jūkan, the priest."
35,10,わがゆかりの物どもは都のうちにあと,The people dear to us remain behind in the capital...
35,11,をとゞめず成りにけりとおもひやるにもしのびがたし。,"Even if we wish to return without delay, it is difficult to escape."
35,12,「抑我等三人は罪もおなじ罪、配所も一つ所也。如何なれば赦免の時、二人は召還されて、一人爰に殘るべき。平家の思忘かや、執筆の誤か。こは如何にしつる事共ぞや。」と、天に仰ぎ地に臥して、泣悲め共かひぞなき。,"How could it be that though our three share the same crime and exile, when mercy was granted, two were recalled while one remains here? Is this a sign of the Taira's ingratitude or an error in the writing? We wept bitterly, appealing to heaven and earth, but found no answer."
35,13,少將の袂にすがて、「俊寛がかく成といふも、御邊の父、故大納言殿、由なき謀反故也。されば餘所の事とおぼすべからず。赦れ無ければ、都迄こそ叶はずとも、此船にのせて、九國の地へ著けて給べ。各の是に坐つる程こそ、春は燕、秋は田面の雁の音信る樣に、自ら故郷の事をも傳聞つれ。今より後、何としてかは聞べき。」とて悶え焦れ給ひけり。,"Clinging to the sleeves of the young general, he said, 'Jūkan’s current state is due to His Majesty’s father, the late Grand Minister, who was falsely accused of rebellion. This matter has nothing to do with other affairs. If mercy cannot be granted, we should at least be taken by ship to Kyushu. Let us each endure our exile as swallows in spring and wild geese in autumn carry messages from their homelands. From now on, let us hear news however we may.' He spoke thus, choked with emotion."
35,14,少將、「誠にさこそは思召され候らめ。我等が召還るゝ嬉さは、去事なれ共、御有様を見置奉るに、行べき空も覺えず。打乘奉ても上たう候が、都の御使も叶ふまじき由申す上、赦れも無に、三人ながら島を出たりなど聞えば、中々惡う候なん。成経先罷上て、人々にも申合せ、入道相國の気色をも窺て、迎に人を奉らん。其間は此日比坐しつる樣に思成て待給へ。何としても命は大切の事なれば、今度こそ漏させ給ふ共、終にはなどか赦免なうて候べき。」と、慰め給へども、人目も知らず泣悶えけり。,"The young general consoled him, saying, 'Truly, this is not how we hoped for. Though we desire to return, we cannot act without the Emperor’s will. Even if we petition, the envoy would surely refuse. If all three are exiled, it would be a great shame. Let Shigehira leave first and consult others. We must gauge the regent’s intentions and send someone to meet us. Until then, let us remain here as if seated together. Your life is precious; we must ensure your survival this time.' But he wept silently, unnoticed by others."
35,15,既に舟出すべしとて、ひしめきあへば、僧都乘ては下つ、下ては乘つあらまし事をぞし給ひける。,"When it was time to depart, the crowd surged forward. The priest boarded, descended, boarded again—such was the confusion in boarding."
35,16,少將の形見には夜の衾、康頼入道が形見には、一部の法華経をぞ留ける。,"As mementos, the young general left a night robe, and Kōrai the priest retained a volume of the Lotus Sutra."
35,17,纜解て押出せば、僧都綱に取附き、腰に成り、脇に成り、長の立つまでは引かれて出で、長も及ばす成ければ、船に取附き「さて如何に各、俊寛をば終に捨果給ふか。,"When the ropes were untied and pushed off, the priest clung to them, waist and side, being dragged until he reached deep water. If not, he would cling to the ship. 'Now we must decide how to abandon Jūkan for good...' they discussed."
35,18,是程とこそ思はざりつれ。,Such thoughts were beyond consideration.
35,19,日來の情も今は何ならず。,Past grievances matter little now.
35,20,只理を枉て乘せ給へ。,"Let justice be done, though heaven may frown."
35,21,責ては、九國の地,"Accounting for it, the nine provinces of Kyushu..."
35,22,迄。,...await their fate.
35,23,」と口説かれけれ共、都の御使「如何にも叶ひ候まじ。」とて、取附給へる手を引のけて、船は終に漕出す。,"They pleaded, 'We must comply with reason,' but the envoy replied, 'It cannot be granted,' and released his hold. The ship finally set sail."
35,24,僧都せん方なさに、渚に上り倒伏し、少き者の乳母や母などを慕ふ樣に、足摺をして、「是乘て行け、具して行け。」と、喚叫べ共、漕行船の習にて、跡は白浪ばかりなり。,"The priest collapsed on the beach, weeping like a child separated from its mother. 'Go on! Go on!' he shouted. According to custom, the boat’s wake left only white waves behind."
35,25,未遠からぬ舟なれども、涙にくれて見えざりければ、僧都高き所に走あがり、澳の方をぞ招ける。,"Though the departure was near, tears blurred his vision. Rising to a high point, he called out towards the bay, waving his sleeve."

The realm will surely prosper again. Since the Great Stupa's restoration is complete, we must now address Aki Province's Itsukushima Shrine and Echizen's Kichijō-in Temple—both manifestations of the Two Realms' teachings.

In a dream vigil there appeared a crowned youth from within the sacred hall: 'This is the deity's envoy. Use this sword to pacify all under heaven and protect the Imperial House.'

If your prayers are answered, you shall be richly rewarded.'"
39,2,「安う候」とて三井寺に歸り、百日肝膽を摧て祈申されければ、中宮軈て百日の内に御懷姙有て、承保元年十二月十六日。,"Ryōkō returned to Mii-dera and, after a hundred days of devoted prayer (kan-dan), the Empress conceived within that same hundred-day period. This occurred on the sixteenth day of the twelfth month of Enkyō 1."

39,4,君なのめならず御感有て,Yet the Empress could not shake her sense of sorrow...

39,6,主上「是こそ存の外の所望なれ。一階僧正などをも申べきかとこそ思召つれ。凡は皇子御誕生有て、皇祚を繼しめん事も、海内無爲を思ふ爲なり。今汝が所望達せば、山門憤て、世上も靜なるべからず。兩門合戰して、天台の佛法亡なんず」とて、御許されも無りけり。,"The Emperor replied: 'This request exceeds all bounds. Would you have me appoint a priest as head monk (ichijō)? For when a prince is born, it is to secure the imperial line and ensure peace. Granting your wish would stir conflict between mountain monasteries (sangō), unsettle the realm, and bring ruin to Tendai Buddhism.' Thus he refused."
39,7,頼豪口惜い事なりとて、三井寺に歸て、干死にせんとす。,"Ryōkō, grieved at this rejection, returned to Mii-dera and resolved to starve himself to death."
39,8,主上大に驚かせ給て、江帥匡房卿其比は未美作守と聞えしを召て、「汝は頼豪と師檀の契有なり。行いて拵て見よ。」と仰ければ、美作守綸言を蒙て、頼豪阿闍梨が宿坊に行向ひ、勅定の趣を仰含んとするに、以の外にふすぼたる持佛堂に立籠て、恐気なる聲して、「天子には戯の言なし、綸言汗の如しとこそ承れ。是程の所望叶はざらんに於ては、我祈出したる皇子なれば、取奉て魔道へこそ行んずらめ。」とて、遂に対面も爲ざりけり。,"The Emperor, greatly alarmed, summoned Lord Kyōfū (formerly known as Saemon no Kami) who had a spiritual connection to Ryōkō. Granting an audience, the priest retreated to a dilapidated chapel where he declared in a trembling voice: 'The Emperor's words are not mere jest—they drip like sweat! If my prayers for this prince are denied, I shall transform him into a demonic being!' Thus he refused direct confrontation."
39,9,美作守歸り參て、此由を奏聞す。,Saemon no Kami returned and reported these events to the throne.
39,10,頼豪は軈て干死に死けり。,Ryōkō eventually perished from self-imposed starvation.

39,15,去程に承暦元年八月六日、皇子御年四歳にて遂に隱させ給ぬ。,"On the sixth day of the eighth month of Enkyū 1, when the prince was four years old, he was secretly secluded."
39,16,敦文の親王是也。,This was Prince Atsuakira.
39,17,主上斜ならず御歎有けり。,"The Emperor lamented deeply, yet could not openly intervene."
39,18,山門に又西京の座主、良信大僧正、其比は圓融坊の僧都とて有驗僧と聞えしを内裏へ召て、「こは如何せんずる。」と仰ければ、「何も、吾山の力にてこそか様の御願は成就,"The Emperor then summoned Ryōnin Daikōsō, chief priest of Mount Hiei's Renge-in temple, renowned for his spiritual power. 'How shall we resolve this?' he asked. The monk replied: 'With the strength of my mountain monastery alone, such a noble wish can be fulfilled"

39,20,九條右丞相、慈慧大僧正に契申させ給しに依てこそ、冷泉院の皇子御誕生は候しか。,"For through the spiritual alliance between Regent Kujō and Daikōsō Jishiki-in, the birth of Emperor Chōzei's prince was made possible."

Within that period, the Empress conceived again, and on the ninth day of the seventh month of Enkyū 3, gave safe birth to another prince."
39,23,堀川の天皇是なり。,This was Emperor Horikawa.
39,24,怨靈は昔もかく怖しかりし事也。,Thus it is proven that vengeful spirits have always been a source of dread.
39,25,今度さしも目出度き御産に、非常の大赦行はれたりといへ共、俊寛僧都一人、赦免無りけるこそうたてけれ。,"Though a grand amnesty was issued for this auspicious birth, even so, the monk Shunkan alone remained unpardoned."

Though urgently summoned to Kyoto, the lingering cold remained fierce; the sea was violently rough, so they took shelter on Pūfū Island for ten days before arriving at Oshima in Bizen."
40,1,其より父大納言殿の住給ける處を尋いりて見給ふに、竹の柱、舊たる障子なんどに書置れたる筆のすさびを見給て、「人の形見には手跡に過たる物ぞなき。書置給はすば、爭か是を見るべき。」とて、康頼入道と二人、讀では泣き、泣いては讀む。,"They then sought out and examined their father, the Dainagon's residence. Seeing writings on bamboo pillars, old shōji doors, and other places: 'There is no remembrance finer than a person's handwriting. Though one might leave notes, why must we see them?'

40,5,此形見を見給てこそ、「さすが欣求淨土の望も御座けり。」と、限なき歎の中にも、聊頼しげには宣けれ。,"Seeing these mementos, they lamented: 'Truly, the aspiration for净土 was not in vain.' Even amidst endless grief, they somewhat consoled themselves with this thought."
40,6,其墓を尋て見給へば、松の一村ある中に、甲斐々々しう壇を築たる事もなし。,"When they inquired about his grave, there was no altar built in a grove of pines."
40,7,土の少し高き所に少將袖掻合せ、生たる人に申樣に、泣々申されけるは、「遠き御守と成せ御座して候事をば、島にて幽に傳へ承しか共、心に任せぬ憂世なれば、急ぎ參る事も候はず。成経彼島へ流れて露の命の消やらずして、二年を送て、召還さるる嬉さは、さる事にて候へ共、此世に渡せ給ふを見參て候はばこそ、命の長きかひもあらめ。是までは急がれつれ共、今日より後は、急ぐべし共覺えずと、掻口説てぞ泣かれける。誠に存生の時ならば、大納言入道殿こそ、如何に共宣ふべきに、生を隔たる習程、恨めしかりける物はなし。苔の下には誰か答ふべき。唯嵐に騒ぐ松の響計也。其後はよもすがら康頼入道と二人、墓の廻を行道して念佛申し、明ぬれば新う壇築き、釘貫せさせ、前に假屋作り、七日七夜、念佛申し経書て結願には大なる卒塔婆を立て、「過去聖靈出離生死、證大菩提」と書て、年號月日の下に、「孝子成經」と書かれたれば、賤山賤の心無も、子に過たる寶はなしとて、涙を流し、袖を絞ぬは無りけり。,"At a slightly elevated spot, Shosho Morikuni's sleeve was pressed together in the manner of the living. He wept: 'Though you served as my distant guardian and I heard of your plight through rumors from the island, unable to trust the world's careslessness, I could not rush to see you. Though Morikuni spent two years in exile with a transient life, upon being recalled, even that joy was meaningless once I beheld this earthly crossing. Until now we hastened, but henceforth let us haste no more,' he tearfully urged. If only the living could speak! Who answers beneath moss? Only the clamor of storm-tossed pines. Thereafter, Priest Konrai and the two circumambulated the grave reciting nembutsu. The next day they built a new altar, drove nails, constructed temporary structures, chanted for seven days and nights, erected a large stupa inscribed: 'May departed saintly spirits escape samsara, attain Supreme Enlightenment,' dated with era name and month beneath: 'Filial Son Morikuni.' With tears streaming, he wrung his sleeves, for even the lowliest mountain had no treasure surpassing one's child."
40,8,年去年來れ共、忘難きは撫育の昔の恩。,"Though years pass, one cannot forget the nurturing grace of past kindnesses."
40,9,夢の如く幻の如し。,"Like a dream, like an illusion."
40,10,尽難きは戀慕の今の涙なり。,The hardest thing to exhaust is the tears of current longing.
40,11,三世十方の佛陀の聖衆も憐み給ひ、亡魂尊靈も、如何に嬉しと覺しけん。,May all Buddhas and saintly beings of the three worlds ten directions have compassion. How could the honored spirits of the departed not rejoice?
40,12,「今暫候て、念佛の功をも積べう候へ共、都に待つ人共も心元なう候らん。又こそ參候は。」とて、亡者に暇申つゝ、泣々そこをぞ立れける。,"They said: 'For now, let us accumulate merit through nembutsu. Those waiting in the capital surely remain unchanged. We shall return.' Thus they petitioned the deceased and tearfully departed."
40,13,草陰にても名殘惜うや思はれけん。,"Even beneath grasses, one would lament the lingering of a name."
40,14,三月十六日少將殿鳥羽へあかうぞ著給ふ。,"On March 16th, Shosho made his way to Uji."
40,15,故大納言殿の山庄、洲濱殿とて鳥羽に在り。,"The former Dainagon's manor, known as Suwabe-dono, stood in Uji."
40,16,住荒,Residing in desolation
40,17,して年経にければ、築地は有共覆もなく、門は有共扉もなし。,"After years passed, though the earth was tilled, there were no roofs. Though gates existed, their doors hung open."
40,18,庭に立入り見給へば、人跡絶て苔深し。,Entering the garden revealed deep moss where human footprints had vanished.
40,19,池の邊を見まはせば、秋の山の春風に、白浪頻に折懸て紫鴛白鴎逍遙す。,"At the pond's edge, white waves danced like autumn mountains in spring wind, purple egrets and white herons wandering freely."
40,20,興ぜし人の戀さに、盡ぬ物は涙也。,The longing of the once-vibrant person leaves only tears unspent.
40,21,家はあれ共、欄門破れ、蔀遣戸も絶てなし。,"Though houses remained, railings were broken and shōji doors disappeared entirely."
40,22,「爰には大納言殿のとこそ坐しか、此妻戸をばかうこそ出入給しか、あの木をば、自らこそ植給しか。」など言ひて、言の葉に附て、父の事を戀しげにこそ宣ひけれ。,"They spoke: 'Here, O former Dainagon, please sit. Use this door to enter and exit; plant that tree yourself.' Through these words, they lamented their father with heartfelt longing."
40,23,弥生中の六日なれば、花は未名殘あり。,"On the sixth day of the peach blossom season, flowers still lingered unnamed."
40,24,楊梅桃李の梢こそ、折知顏に色々なれ。,"Plum, apricot, peach, and plum blossoms adorned their branches with various hues."
40,25,昔の主はなけれ共、春を忘れぬ花なれや。,"Though the master is gone, these flowers forget not spring."
40,26,少將花の下に立寄て、桃李不言春幾暮、煙霞無跡昔誰栖。,Shosho paused beneath the blossoms: 'Peach and plum do not speak of spring's passage. Who now dwells where misty clouds once lingered?'
40,27,故郷の花の言ふ世なりせば、如何に昔の事を問まし。,"If these flowers spoke of their homeland, how might they answer questions about the past?"
40,28,此古き詩歌を口ずさみ給へば、康頼入道も折節哀に覺えて、墨染の袖をぞ濕しける。,"When this ancient poem was recited, even Priest Konrai, moved to sorrow, wet his ink-stained sleeves."
40,29,暮る程とは待れけれ共、餘に名殘惜くて、夜更る迄こそ坐けれ。,"Though night approached and could have been awaited, they remained seated until dawn through lingering attachment."
40,30,更行まゝに、荒たる宿の習とて、古き軒の板間よりもる月影ぞ隈もなき。,"Passing through the night, in this desolate lodging's custom, moonlight without shadows surpassed even ancient eaves' plank cracks."
40,31,鷄籠の山明なんとすれ共、家路は更に急がれず。,"Though Mount Kikugō's dawn broke, the homeward path offered no urgency."
40,32,さてしも有べき事ならねば、迎に乘物ども遣て、待らんも心なしとて、泣々洲濱殿を出つゝ、都へ歸り入給けん人々の心の中共、さこそは哀にも嬉しうも有けめ。,"Had there been reason, they might have sent attendants to meet them. With no expectation of waiting, the Suwabe-dono crowd departed weeping. In their hearts lay a mixture of sorrow and joy as they entered Kyoto."
40,33,康頼入道が迎にも乘物有けれ共其には乗らで、「今更名殘の惜に。」とて、少將の車の尻に乘て、七條河原までは行く。,"Though Priest Konrai had a carriage, he chose not to ride: 'Now I lament the fading name.' He clung to Shosho's cart until reaching Kamo Riverbank at Shichijō."
40,34,其より行別れけるに、猶行もやらざりけり。,"At parting, he still could not depart."
40,35,花の下の半日の客、月の前の一夜の友、旅人が一村雨の過行に、一樹の陰に立よて、別るゝ名殘も惜きぞかし。,"A half-day guest beneath blossoms, a single night's friend before the moon—travelers standing in village rain under one tree's shade, lamenting the parting of lingering names."
40,36,況や是は憂かりし島の栖、,"How much more this sorrowful island exile,"
40,37,船の中、浪の上、一業所感の身なれば、前世の芳縁も不淺や思ひしられけん。,"Who, as one whose entire existence was felt in a single karmic place—might not recall the fragrant bonds of past lives?"
40,38,少將は舅平宰相の宿所へ立入給ふ。,"Shosho entered his maternal grandfather, the Minister of the Left's lodging."
40,39,少將の母上は、靈山に坐けると云ひて、昨日より宰相の宿所に坐て待れけり。,"His mother, said to dwell in the sacred mountain, had been waiting at the minister's lodging since yesterday."
40,40,少將の立入給ふ姿を一目見て、「命あれば」と計ぞのたまひける。,"Upon seeing Shosho enter, she exclaimed: 'If only life were granted!'"
40,41,引被てぞ臥給ふ。,"She lay down, drawing her bedding close."
40,42,宰相の内の女房侍共さしつどひて、皆悦び泣共しけり。,"The minister's attendants gathered, all weeping with joy."
40,43,増て少將の北の方、乳母の六條が心の中、さこそは嬉しかりけめ。,"Moreover, in Shosho's northern quarters, his nurse Rokujo felt profound gladness."
40,44,六條は盡せぬ物思ひに黒かりし髮も皆白く成り、北の方、さしも花やかにうつくしう坐しか共、いつしか痩衰へて、其人とも見え給はず。,"Rokujo, consumed by unending thoughts, had turned her black hair white. Though she sat elegantly in the northern quarters like a flower, gradually wasting away, she became unrecognizable."
40,45,少將の流され給し時、三歳にて別給し稚き人、長う成て髮結ふ程也。,"When Shosho was exiled, this child separated at three years old had grown to束 hair."
40,46,又其傍に三つ計なる少き人の坐けるを、少將「あれは如何に。」と宣へば、六條「是こそ」とばかり申て、袖を顏におし當て、涙を流しけるにこそ、「さては下りし時、心苦げなる有様を見置しが、事故なく育けるよ。」と思出ても悲かりけり。,"Seeing three small children nearby, Shosho asked: 'What are these?' Rokujo, covering her face with sleeves to weep: 'These were the pitiful figures I left behind, now raised safely.' She recalled his departure's hardships and lamented anew."
40,47,少將は本の如く院に召仕はれて、宰相中將にあがり給ふ。,"Shosho was reinstated to court service, becoming Vice-Minister of the Interior as planned."
40,48,康頼入道は、東山雙林寺に、我山庄の有ければ、其に落著て、先思續けけり。,"Priest Konrai settled at Sōrin-ji on Mount Higashiyaama, continuing ancestral traditions in his manor there."
40,49,故郷の軒の板間に苔むして、思し程は洩ぬ月かな。,Moss crept over the planks of his homeland's veranda—the full extent of longing could not be contained even by moonlight.
40,50,軈てそこに籠居して、憂かりし昔を髮思續け、寶物集と云ふ物語を書けけるとぞ聞えし。,"Confining himself there, he braided his hair with memories of sorrowful pasts and composed the Tales of Treasures."
41,0,去程に鬼界島へ三人流されたりし流人二人は召還され都へ上りぬ。,"Of the three men exiled to Kibitsu-jima on a previous journey, two were recalled and returned to the capital."

41,6,如何に」と問へば、「其は猶罪深しとて、島に殘され給ぬ。」と聞て、心憂なども愚也。,"When asked, 'Why?' we were told, 'He remains on the island for his grave sins.' How foolish our anxiety was."
41,7,常は六波羅邊にたゝずみありいて聞けれども、赦免有るべし共聞出ず。,"Though we had long stayed near Rokuhara awaiting news, no pardon was ever announced."
41,8,僧都の御娘の忍びて坐ける所へ參て、「此せにも洩させ給て、御上りも候はず。如何にもして彼島へ渡て、御行へを尋參らせんとこそ思立て候へ。御文賜はらん。」と申すれば、泣々書て賜だりけり。,"The monk’s daughter secretly approached him, saying, 'Please let this be conveyed... I wish to cross the island and seek news of his whereabouts. Grant me a letter.' She wept as she wrote it."
41,9,暇を請共、よも赦さじとて、父にも母にも知せず。,"Though he pleaded for mercy, knowing pardon was impossible, he told neither father nor mother."

41,12,薩摩より彼島へ渡る船津にて、人怪み、著たる物を剥取などしけれ共、少しも後悔せず、姫御前の御文計ぞ人に見せじとて、髻結の中に隱したり。,"At the harbor where ships departed for the island, though people mocked us and stripped our clothes, we regretted nothing. To protect Lady Ubuyama’s letter, we hid it in our braids."
41,13,さて商人船に乘て件の島へ渡て見に、都にて幽に傳聞しは、事の數にもあらず。,"We boarded a merchant ship to reach the island, but the rumors whispered in Kyoto about its horrors proved true."

41,21,唯頭を掉て「知ず」と言ふ。,"They merely shook their heads and said, 'We know not.'"
41,22,其中に或者が心得て、「いさとよ、左様の人は三人是に有しが、二人は召還されて都へ上りぬ。今一人は殘されて、あそこ此に惑ひ歩けども、行方も知らず。」とぞ言ひける。,"One among them, however, whispered: 'Indeed, there were three such men. Two returned to Kyoto, but the third remains lost here, wandering blindly—no one knows his fate.'"
41,23,山の方の覺束なさに、遙に分入り、嶺に攀、谷に下れ共、白雲跡を埋んで、往來の道もさだかならず、晴嵐夢を破て其面影も見ざりけり。,"The mountains were desolate; we climbed peaks and descended valleys, but the white clouds buried all traces. The paths were unknown, and even in clear weather, his face remained a shattered dream."
41,24,山にては終に尋も逢はず、海の邊に著て尋るに、沙頭に印を,"In the mountains, we found no trace. By the sea, footprints on the shore—"

41,30,「都にて多くの乞丐人見しか共、かゝる者をば未見ず、『諸阿修羅等故在大海邊』とて、修羅の三惡四趣は深山大海の邊に有と、佛の説置給ひたれば、知らず、我餓鬼道に尋來るか。」と思ふほどに、彼も此も次第に歩近づく「若か様の者も、我主の御行末知たる事や在ん。」と、「物申さう。」と言ば「何事」答ふ。,"In Kyoto, we’d seen many beggars, but never such a wraith. 'As the sutras say, hungry ghosts dwell beyond the sea...' We approached him: 'Do you know our lord’s fate?' He answered only: 'What is it?'"
41,31,「是に都より流され給し法勝寺の執行御房と申す人の御行末や知たる。」と問に、童は見忘たれ共、僧都は何か忘べきなれば、「是こそ其よ。」と云も敢ず、手に持る物を投捨て、沙の上に倒伏す。,"When we asked, 'Do you know the fate of the monk from Jisho-ji?', the boy seemed to forget. The priest could not say, 'This is he,' so he dropped his belongings and collapsed on the sand."
41,32,さてこそ我主の行末も知てけれ。,Thus we learned of our lord’s fate at last.

Through countless waves, you sought him in vain—why show this sorrowful sight?' The priest calmed us: 'Your devotion is divine... If you dreamt this, what becomes of reality? But since it is real...' Ubuyama replied, 'Indeed. Grant me life through this mercy.' And he said: 'Thus shall it be.'"

Though foolish, he climbed mountains for sulfur to trade with merchants. Now his strength failed; even this he could not do."

In the north, they hid a few people and made them endure hardships with horses. This child would occasionally visit the palace, though there was no reason for lamentation. Yet because he was young, they allowed him to return repeatedly, each time saying: ""O Ariwara, if you go to the Island of Hell..."" However, in February, he failed to keep his promise and disappeared. The northern officials, overwhelmed by grief over this incident, grew weaker daily until on March 2nd, he perished suddenly. Now only the princess remains, having crossed to her aunt's residence in Nara. This is what your letter states.' She presented it with these words."

It is pitiful that only a woman's heart is stirred. If it were a man, one would inquire even about the distant islands where they are sent. Summon Ariwara at once.'"
42,7,「是見よ、有王。此子が文の書樣のはかなさよ。己を伴にて、急ぎ上れと書たるこそ恨しけれ。心に任せたる俊寛が身ならば、何とてか三年の春秋をば送るべき。今年は十二に成とこそ思に、是程はかなくては、人にも見え、宮仕をもして、身をも扶くべきか。」とて泣れけるにこそ、人の親の心は闇にあらね共、子を思ふ道に迷ふ程も知れけれ。,"'See this child's pitiful letter! To write, ""Come quickly with me,"" is lamentable. If it were someone like Shukken, who acts on principle, they would not have wasted three years. Now that he is twelve, why die so suddenly? Though ashamed before others, one must still uphold their dignity.' They wept, though a parent's heart in darkness might not understand the depth of such longing."

Who leads this Minamoto force today?' Ise Saburo Yoshimori stepped forward: 'This is absurd! The Ninth Lord Magistrate, younger brother of Kama no Kyo, scion of the tenth generation from Emperor Seiwa!' Shigetsugu replied: 'Indeed, so it seems. Orphaned when my father fell in the Heiji Conflict, I became a stablehand, later serving as a merchant's attendant carrying provisions to Dewa Province - such was this humble samurai.'"

I've heard you live in seclusion on Suzuka Mountain, supporting a family - yet here we are!''Kaneko Kazumasa interrupted: 'Foolish talk from a minor retainer! All would speak falsely rather than repeat such nonsense. Last spring at Ichinotani, even Musashi and Sagami's young lords saw our valor!'

Raising their horses' heads in unison to shield the general's advance, their combined strength proved unstoppable."

Dismounting, he grasped his hand: 'How do you fare?' At the man's labored reply, Yoshitsune asked if there were concerns. 'What need of plans? To die in battle as archers should - that was my hope! Especially since Sato Toshinobu of Dewa fell at Hachiman Beach in Sanuki fulfilling his lord's command. Such tales are our honor in this life and memory beyond.' Weeping, Yoshitsune ordered a priest brought: 'For today's wounds, let sutras be chanted.' He presented the black stallion with gold-inlaid saddle to the monk."

44,73,凡は此大臣文章麗うして、心に忠を存し、才藝勝て、詞に徳を兼給へり。,"This minister excelled in elegant prose, upheld loyalty, combined talent and moral integrity."
45,0,天性此大臣は、不思議の人にて、未來の事をも兼て悟給けるにや、去四月七日の夢に、見給ける事こそ不思議なれ。,"This minister, by his innate nature, was a man of wonder who could intuitively perceive future events. Is it not strange that in the dream he had on the seventh day of the fourth month last year, he foresaw what was to come?"
45,1,譬ば、何く共知らぬ濱路を遙々と歩行給ふ程に、道の傍に大なる鳥居有るを、「あれは如何なる鳥居やらん。」と問給へば、「春日大明神の御鳥居なり。」と申。,"For instance, while walking a distant shore path unknown to him, he saw a great torii by the road and asked, 'What is this torii?' The answer came: 'This is the sacred gate of Kasuga Myōjin.'"
45,2,人多く群集したり。,A crowd had gathered.
45,3,其中に、法師の頭を一つ指擧たり。,"Among them, someone pointed out a monk's severed head."
45,4,「さてあのくびは如何に。」と問給へば、是は平家太政入道殿の御頭を惡行超過し給へるに依て、當社大明神の召取せ給て候。,"When asked, 'What of that head?' it was explained: 'This is the head of Taira no Kiyomori, the Great Minister. For his transgressions against divine law, he has been summoned and taken by this shrine's deity.'"
45,5,」と申と覺えて、夢打覺ぬ。,"Upon hearing these words, he awoke abruptly from the dream."
45,6,当家は保元平治より以降、度々の朝敵を平げて、勸賞身に餘り、忝く一天の君の御外戚として、一族の昇進六十餘人。,"Since the Hōgen and Heiji disturbances, our house had repeatedly crushed imperial enemies, receiving abundant rewards. As honored kinsmen to His Majesty, sixty-three of our clan attained high rank."
45,7,二十餘年の以降は、楽榮え申計も無りつるに、入道の惡行超過せるに依て、一門の運命既に盡んずるにこそと、こし方行末の事共思召續けて、御涙に咽ばせ給ふ。,"After twenty years of prosperity, with no foreseeable decline—yet because the Priest (Kiyomori) exceeded his bounds through wicked deeds—the fate of our entire clan was sealed. We lamented these portents, choked with tears."
45,8,折節妻戸をほと／＼と打敲く。,"At that moment, he struck his wife's quarters violently."
45,9,「誰そ。あれ聞。」と宣へば、「瀬尾太郎兼康が參て候。」と申。,"Calling out, 'Who is it? Answer!' came the reply: 'It is Saeo no Tarō Kanemasa who has come.'"
45,10,「如何に、何事ぞ。」とのたまへば、「只今、不思議の事候て、夜の明候はんが遲う覺え候間、申さんが爲に參て候。御前の人を除られ候へ。」と申ければ、大臣人を遙に除て対面あり。,"The minister asked, 'What troubles you? Speak!' Kanemasa explained: 'A strange matter has arisen. Lest the night's darkness delay me further in serving Your Lordship, I came here—though a woman of your presence was dismissed.' At these words, the minister summoned him forward."
45,11,さて兼康が見たりける夢の樣を始より終まで委しう語り申けるが、大臣の御覽じたりける御夢に少しも違はず。,"Kanemasa recounted his entire dream from beginning to end, and it matched the minister's vision perfectly."
45,12,さてこそ瀬尾太郎兼康をば、神にも通じたる者にてありけりと大臣も感じ給ひけれ。,"Thus did the minister realize: 'Truly, this Saeo no Tarō Kanemasa is one who communes even with the gods.'"
45,13,その朝嫡子權亮少將維盛院の御所へ參んとて出させ給たりけるを、大臣呼奉て、「人の親の身としてか樣の事を申せば、きはめてをこがましけれ共、御邊の人は子共の中には勝て見え給,"That morning, when the minister sent his son, Junior Captain Yoshimori, to court, he called out: 'Though as a father I must restrain myself from speaking plainly, those close to Your Lordship should know that'"
45,14,ふ也。,...
45,15,但此世の中の在樣いかゞあらむずらんと心細うこそ覺ゆれ。,But the uncertainty of this world's vicissitudes fills me with dread.
45,16,貞能は無いか、少將に酒進めよ。,"Zenyō, bring sake to the young general!"
45,17,」と宣へば、貞能御酌に參りたり。,"Upon command, Zenyō served the wine."
45,18,「此盞をば先づ少將にこそ取せたけれ共、親より先にはよも飲給はじなれば、重盛まづ取擧げて少將にさゝん。」とて、三度受て、少將にぞ差されける。,"The minister said, 'Though this cup should first go to the general, one must not drink before one's parent. Therefore, Chikamasa shall take it first and pass it on.' Thus, after three transfers, it reached the young general."
45,19,少將又三度うけ給ふ時、「如何に貞能引出物せよ。」と宣へば、畏て承り、錦の袋に入たる御太刀を取出す。,"When the general received it three times, the minister said: 'Now, Zenyō, present your offering.' With reverence, he produced a sword wrapped in brocade."
45,20,「あはれ是は家に傳はれる小烏と云ふ太刀やらん。」など、世に嬉気に思ひて見給ふ處に、さはなくして、大臣葬の時用る無文の太刀にてぞ有ける。,"The general marveled, 'Alas! This must be the family's cherished sword, the Kogarasu-maru.' But upon inspection, it proved to be the plain ceremonial blade reserved for the minister's own funeral rites."
45,21,其時少將気色はとかはて世に忌はしげに見給ければ、大臣涙をはら／＼と流して、「如何に少將其は貞能が咎にも非ず。其故は如何にと云に、此太刀は大臣葬の時用る無文の太刀也。入道如何にもおはせん時、重盛が帶て供せんとて持たりつれ共、今は重盛、入道殿に先立奉んずれば、御邊に奉るなり。」とぞ宣ける。,"Noticing the general's pallor, the minister wept: 'Why do you fear? This is no fault of Zenyō. Understand: this sword was meant for my own burial. Though Chikamasa intended to wear it when serving the Priest (Kiyomori), now that both he and the Priest have preceded me in death, it remains here.'"
45,22,少將之を聞給てとかうの返事にも及ばず。,The general could find no words to reply.
45,23,涙に咽びうつぶして、其日は出仕もし給はず、引かづきてぞ伏渡ふ。,"Swallowing his grief, he never attended court that day but withdrew in humility."
45,24,其後大臣熊野へ詣り下向して病つき、幾程もなくして遂に失給けるにこそ、實にもと思知られけれ。,"Later, the minister journeyed to Kumano Shrine where he fell ill and soon passed away—fulfilling the dread portent."
46,0,すべて此大臣は、滅罪生善の御志深う坐ければ、當来の浮沈を歎いて東山の麓に、六八弘誓の願になぞらへて、四十八間の精舎を建て、一間に一つづゝ、四十八間に四十八の燈籠を掛られければ、九品の臺目の前に輝き、光耀鸞鏡を琢て、淨土の砌に臨めるが如し。,"All this minister, sitting deeply in the lord's resolve to eliminate sins and cultivate virtue, lamented future vicissitudes and built forty-eight rooms of temple structures at the foot of Higashiyama, modeling them after the弘誓 (Great Vow) of sixty-eight merits. For each room, a single lantern was hung—forty-eight in total—and they shone before the nine stages of rebirth's dais, polishing the mirror of light and radiance as if facing the Pure Land's steps."
46,1,毎月十,Every tenth [day]
46,2,四日十五日を点じて、当家他家の人々の御方より、みめよく若う盛なる女房達を多く請じ聚め、一間に六人づつ、四十八間に二百八十八人、時衆に定て、彼兩日が間は、一心稱名聲斷ず、誠に来迎引攝の悲願も、此所に影向を垂れ、攝取不捨の光も、此大臣を照し給ふかとぞ見えし。,"On the 4th and 15th days, he gathered many young and beautiful court ladies from his own and others' households, assigning six to each room—288 in total across forty-eight rooms. The monks were fixed in place; for those two days, they chanted names without distraction. Indeed, even the compassionate vow to welcome and save sentient beings cast its shadow here, and the light of unyielding salvation shone upon this minister as if to illuminate him."
46,3,十五日の日中を結願として、大念佛有しに、大臣自ら彼の行道の中に交て、西方に向ひ、「南無安養世界教主　彌陀善逝、三界六道の衆生を普く濟度し給へ。」と、迴向発願せられければ、見る人慈悲を起し、聞く者感涙を催けり。,"On the 15th day at midday, as a concluding vow accompanied by great nembutsu (Buddhist chant), the minister himself joined the procession and faced westward, declaring: 'Homage to the World-Honored One of Sukhavati, Amitabha Tathagata—may you universally save all sentient beings in the three realms and six paths.' When this vow was made with turning merit, those who saw it were moved by compassion, and those who heard it wept."
46,4,かかりしかば此大臣をば燈籠大臣とぞ人申ける。,"Thus, this minister came to be called the 'Lantern Minister' by people."
47,0,又大臣吾朝には如何なる大善根をし置たり共、子孫相續で、弔ん事有がたし。,"Though the minister of our era performed great meritorious deeds, due to the lineage of descendants, mourning was not done."
47,1,他国に如何なる善根をもして、後世をとぶらはればやと、安元の比ほひ、鎮西より妙典と云ふ船頭をめし上せ、人を遙に除て対面有り。,"To secure what kind of merit in a foreign land to ascend to the afterlife, during the Angen era, they summoned a boatman named Myoten from Kyushu and arranged a distant meeting through intermediaries."
47,2,金を三千五百両召寄て、「汝は大正直の者であんなれば、五百両をば汝に給ぶ。三千両をば宋朝へ渡し、育王山へ參せて、千両を僧に引き、二千兩をば御門へ參せ、田代を育王山へ申寄て、我が後世弔はせよ。」とぞ宣ひける。,"They gathered 3,500 ryō of gold and declared: 'If you are truly virtuous, I shall give you 500 ryō. Take 3,000 ryō to Song China, visit Yüehwang Mountain, allocate 1,000 ryō to monks, present 2,000 ryō to the imperial court, and dedicate land at Yüehwang Mountain to memorialize my posthumous rites.'"
47,3,妙典是を賜て、萬里の煙浪を凌つゝ、大宋國へぞ渡りける。,"Myoten, receiving this reward, braved the ten thousand miles of billowing waves and crossed to Great Song."
47,4,育王山の方丈、佛照禪師徳光に逢奉り、此由申したりければ、隨喜感嘆して、千両を僧に引き、二千兩をば御門へ參せ、大臣の申されける旨を具に奏聞せられたりければ、御門大に感じ思召て、五百町の田代を育王山へぞ寄られける。,"At Yüehwang Mountain, they paid respects to the Zen master Tokkou Fusho. Upon hearing this account, he rejoiced and allocated 1,000 ryō to monks, presented 2,000 ryō to the imperial court, and when fully reported the minister's request, the court graciously donated 500 cho of land to Yüehwang Mountain."
47,5,さ,So
47,6,れば日本の大臣、平朝臣重盛公の後生善所と祈る事、今に斷ずとぞ承る。,"Thus, it is known that the posthumous merits sought by Minister Taira no Shigemori of Japan have now been fulfilled."
48,0,入道相國小松殿に後れ給て、萬心細うや思はれけん、福原へ馳下り、閉門してこそ座けれ。,"Although following Lord Komatsu of the Retired Regent's House, my heart becomes anxious; therefore, I hasten to Fukuhara and sit closed within the gate."
48,1,同十一月七日の夜戌刻許、大地おびたゞしう動て良久し。,"On the night of the seventh day of the same November, around the hour of the Dog, the great earth shook violently for quite some time."
48,2,陰陽頭安倍泰親、急ぎ内裏へ馳參て、「今夜の地震、占文の指す所其愼輕からず。當道三経の中に、坤儀經の説を見候に、『年を得ては年を出ず、月を得ては月を出ず、日を得ては日を出ず。』と見えて候。以の外に火急候。」とて、はらはらとぞ泣ける。,"The Onmyoji Head Abe Yasuhira hurried to the Imperial Court, declaring: 'Tonight's earthquake is no minor matter as per the divination texts. In our Three Classics of Governance, the *Kinji-kyo* states: ""When a year is gained, it is not retained; when a month is gained, it is not retained; when a day is gained, it is not retained."" This requires urgent action.' He trembled and wept."
48,3,傳奏の人も色を失ひ、君も叡慮を驚せ坐ます。,The chamberlain's attendants also lose color; the sovereign sits in shock at this profound concern.
48,4,若き公卿殿上人は「怪からぬ泰親が今の泣樣や、何事の有るべき。」とて、笑合れけり。,Young court nobles remarked: 'How strange that Yasuhira cries now—what great misfortune could this signify?' They exchanged amused glances.
48,5,され共此泰親は、晴明五代の苗裔を請て、天文は淵源を窮め、推條掌を指が如し。,"Yet this Yasuhira, descendant of Abe no Seimei's fifth generation, had mastered astronomy with scholarly depth, his finger pointing to the stars as though they were palm lines."
48,6,一事も違はざりければ、指神子とぞ申ける。,"If even one detail differed, he would declare it divine guidance."
48,7,雷の落懸りたりしか共、雷火の爲に、狩衣の袖は燒ながら、其身は恙も無りけり。,"Though struck by lightning, his hunting robe sleeve burned while his body remained unharmed."
48,8,上代にも末代にも、有がたかりし泰親なり。,"From ancient to modern times, there was no equal to Yasuhira."
48,9,同十四日、相國禪門此日比福原におはしけるが、何とか思ひなられたりけん。,"On the fourteenth day, the Retired Regent-monk had arrived at Fukuhara, his intentions remaining inscrutable."
48,10,數千騎の軍兵をたなびいて、都へ入給ふ由聞えしかば、京中何と聞わきたる事は無れ共、上下恐れおののく。,"When word reached Kyoto that thousands of troops accompanied the Retired Regent's entry, though no explicit threat was declared, all ranks trembled in fear."
48,11,何者の申出したりけるやらん。,Who could discern the source of these rumors?
48,12,入道相國朝家を恨み奉べしと披露をなす。,The Retired Regent publicly lamented his grudge against Chancellor Tadamori.
48,13,關白殿、内内聞召るゝ旨や有けん、急ぎ御參内有て、「今度相國禪門入洛の事は、ひとへに基房亡すべき結構にて候也。如何なる憂目にか逢べきやらん。」と、奏せさせ給へば、主上大に驚せ給。,"Upon hearing the Regent's innermost thoughts, the Chancellor hastened to court, declaring: 'This monk-regent's return spells utter ruin for Lord Michimasa. What dire calamity awaits us?' The sovereign was greatly alarmed."
48,14,て、「そこに如何なる目にも逢むは偏にたゞ吾逢にてこそ有んずらめ。」とて、御涙を流させ給ふぞ忝き。,"The sovereign wept, exclaiming: 'I alone must confront whatever fate awaits—there is no avoiding this.'"
48,15,誠に天下の御政は主上攝,"Indeed, governance of the realm rightfully belongs to the sovereign."
48,16,録の御計にてこそ有に、こは如何にしつる事共ぞや。,Yet how shall this be resolved? The matter remains unresolved.
48,17,天照大神春日大明神の神慮の程も量がたし。,Even the deities Amaterasu and Kasuga's wills are inscrutable.
48,18,同十五日、入道相國朝家を恨奉るべき事、必定と聞えしかば、法皇大に驚せ給て、故少納言信西の子息靜憲法印を御使にて、入道相國の許へ遣さる。,"On the fifteenth day, learning of the Retired Regent's vengeance against Tadamori, the Cloistered Emperor sent Priest Shikken (son of late Minister Nobuyasu) to negotiate."
48,19,「近年朝廷靜ならずして、人の心も調らず、世間も落居せぬ樣に成行く事、惣別に附て歎思召せ共、さてそこにあれば、萬事は頼思召てこそ有に、天下を靜る迄こそ無らめ、嗷々なる體にて、剩へ朝家を恨むべしなど聞召すは、何事ぞ。」と仰遣はさる。,"The imperial message read: 'Though recent court turmoil has unsettled hearts and destabilized society, we lament this—yet why now, with the realm needing tranquility, must you harbor vengeance against Tadamori? What purpose does this serve?'"
48,20,静憲法印御使に西八條の邸へ向ふ。,Priest Shikken journeyed to the West Hachijo Residence.
48,21,朝より夕に及ぶ迄待れけれ共、無音なりければ、去ばこそと無益に覚えて、源大夫判官季貞をもて、勅定の趣言入させ、「暇申て。」とて出られければ、其とき入道、「法印よべ。」とて出されたり。,"From dawn to dusk he waited, but receiving no response, he departed—only for Retired Regent Kiyomori to suddenly emerge: 'Priest Shikken, come in.'"
48,22,喚かへいて、「やゝ、法印の御房、淨海が申所は僻事か。,"Summoned inside, Kiyomori asked: 'Shikken, is this truly the priest's advice—that we should abandon our ancestral bonds?'"
48,23,先内府が身罷候ぬる事、當家の運命を計にも、入道隨分悲涙を押てこそ罷過候へ。,"Kiyomori pressed: 'Though I grieve Tadamori's death, my family's survival depends on this. How can you speak of abandoning our lineage?' Tears choked his words."
48,24,御邊の心にも推察し給へ。,The sovereign's intentions were also discernible.
48,25,保元以後は亂逆打つゞいて、君安い御心も渡せ給はざりしに、入道は唯大方を執行ふ許りでこそ候へ。,"Since the Hogen Disturbance, with rebellion rampant and the sovereign's peace unattainable, Kiyomori had only ever enforced necessary measures."
48,26,内府こそ手を下し身を碎て、度々の逆鱗をば休め參せて候へ。,"Tadamori himself had repeatedly restrained Kiyomori, even at great personal risk."
48,27,其外臨時の御大事、朝夕の政務、内府程の功臣は有難うこそ候らめ。,"For emergency matters and daily governance, there could be no greater meritous subject than Tadamori."
48,28,爰を以て古を憶ふに、唐の太宗は魏徴に後て、悲の餘に、『昔の殷宗は夢の中に良弼を得、今の朕は覺ての後賢臣を失ふ。,"Recalling history: Emperor Taizong of Tang, after losing Wei Zheng, lamented: 'The Yin dynasty gained a virtuous minister in dreams; I have lost mine awake.'"
48,29,』と云ふ碑文を自書て、廟に立てだにこそ悲給けるなれ。,"He inscribed this epitaph, weeping bitterly at his temple."
48,30,我朝にも、間近く見候し事ぞかし。,Our own nation has seen such parallels recently.
48,31,顯頼民部卿逝去したりしをば、故院,"With Minister Minbu Kenryo's passing, the Cloistered Emperor..."
48,32,殊に御歎有て、八幡の行幸延引し、御遊無りき。,"especially mourned, delaying his pilgrimage to Hachiman Shrine and abandoning leisure."
48,33,惣て臣下の卒するをば、代代の御門皆御歎ある事でこそ候へ。,"Indeed, whenever a minister dies, all imperial houses share the sovereign's grief."
48,34,さればこそ親よりもなつかしう、子よりもむつまじきは君と臣との中とは申事にて候らめ。,"Thus, between sovereign and subject lies a bond closer than parent-child."
48,35,され共内府が中陰に、八幡の御幸有て御遊有き。,"Yet when Tadamori died, the sovereign continued his Hachiman pilgrimage and outings."
48,36,御歎の色一事も之を見ず。,Without a trace of mourning.
48,37,縱入道が悲を御憐なく共、などか内府が忠を思召し忘させ給ふべき。,"Even if Kiyomori grieves, how could he forget Tadamori's loyalty?"
48,38,縱内府が忠を思召忘させ給ふ共、爭か入道が嘆きを御憐無らん。,"Even if Tadamori's fidelity is forgotten, why would Kiyomori not pity his grief?"
48,39,父子ともに叡慮に背候ぬる事、今に於て面目を失ふ。,Both father and son have acted against reason—now shamed before all.
48,40,是一つ。,First point.
48,41,次に越前國をば、子子孫孫まで、御変改有まじき由、御約束在て給はて候しを、内府に後て後、やがて召され候事は、何の過怠にて候やらむ。,"Next, regarding Echizen Province: Though promised perpetual sovereignty to Tadamori's lineage, his death led to its sudden revocation—what transgression could justify this?"
48,42,是一つ。,Second point.
48,43,次に中納言闕の候し時、二位中將の所望候しを、入道隨分執申しか共、遂に御承引なくして、関白の息を成さるゝ事は如何に。,"Third, when the Middle Counselor's position was vacant: Though Kiyomori advocated for Second Captain's desires, the sovereign refused and appointed the Regent's son instead—how could this be?"
48,44,たとひ入道如何なる非據を申おこなふ共、一度はなどか聞召入れでは候べき。,"Even if Kiyomori erred, his proposals should have been heard."
48,45,申候はんや、家嫡と云ひ、位階と云ひ、理運左右に及ばぬ事を、引違させ給ふは、本意なき御計とこそ存候へ。,To dismiss matters of lineage and rank—things beyond mortal control—as unworthy consideration reveals a flawed strategy.
48,46,是一つ。,Fourth point.
48,47,次に新大納言成親卿已下、鹿谷に寄合て、謀反の企候し事、全く私の計略に非ず。,"Fifth, regarding New Grand Minister Naritoyo and the鹿谷 Conspiracy: This was not my private scheme."
48,48,併君御許容有に依て也。,It occurred with your sovereign's tacit approval.
48,49,今めかしき申事にて候へども、七代迄は、此一門をば爭か捨させ給ふべき。,"Though I now speak boldly, must we abandon this family line within seven generations?"
48,50,其に入道七旬に及で、餘命幾くならぬ一期の内にだにも、動もすれば亡すべき由御計らひあり。,"Moreover, I am now seventy—my remaining days are numbered. Any action risks immediate death."
48,51,申候はんや、子孫相ついで、朝家に召仕れん事有がたし。,To suggest my descendants serve the court is a great kindness.
48,52,凡老て子を失ふは、枯木の枝無に異ならず。,An old man losing his son is like a withered tree losing its branch.
48,53,今は程なき浮世に、心を費ても、何かはせんなれば、いかでも有なんとこそ、思成て候へ。,"In this unstable world, despite my efforts, I can accomplish nothing—I merely wish to depart peacefully."
48,54,」とて、且は腹立し、且は落涙し給へば、法印恐うも又哀にも覺て、汗水に成り給ぬ。,"Kiyomori thus spoke, his anger and tears mingling until the priest trembled in fear and sorrow, drenched in sweat."
48,55,其時は如何なる人も、一言の返事に及がたき事,No one dared respond—not a word could be found.
48,56,ぞかし。,Truly remarkable.
48,57,其上我身も近習の仁也。,"Furthermore, I am merely your retainer."
48,58,鹿谷に寄合たりし事を正しう見聞れしかば、其人數とて、只今も召や籠られんずらんと思ふに、龍の鬚を撫で虎の尾を蹈む心地はせられけれども、法印もさる怖い人で、些もさわがず、申されけるは、「誠に度々の御奉公淺からず。一旦恨申させ坐す旨、其謂候。但官位と云ひ俸禄と云ひ、御身に取ては悉く滿足す。されば功の莫大なる事をも君御感有でこそ候へ。然に近臣事を亂り、君御許容有といふ事、謀臣の凶害にてぞ候らん。耳を信じて目を疑ふは、俗の常の弊也。小人の浮言を重うして、朝恩の他に異なるに、君を背き參させ給はん事と、冥顯につけて、其恐すくなからず候。凡天心は蒼々として測難し、叡慮定て此儀でぞ候らん。下として上に逆る事は、豈人臣の禮たらんや。能能御思惟候べし。詮ずる所、此趣をこそ披露仕候はめ。」とて出られければ、幾等も竝居たる人人、「穴怖し。入道のあれ程怒り給へるに、些も恐れず、返事うちして立るゝ事よ。」とて、法印を譽ぬ人こそ無かりけれ。,"Having personally witnessed the鹿谷 conspiracy, I knew full well their numbers would now incriminate us. Yet despite the peril—like stroking a dragon's beard or treading on a tiger's tail—I remained calm before Shikken, declaring: 'Your service has been invaluable. This outburst stems from deep frustration. While your rank and stipend are adequate, the sovereign's favor for ministers must not overshadow wisdom. To trust rumor over truth is folly—how could we ever repay such loyalty? The heavens are inscrutable, but I implore you to reflect.' Upon departing, all present marveled: 'Remarkable! How Shikken dared rebut Kiyomori's wrath without fear!'"
49,0,法印御所へ参て、此由奏聞せられければ、法皇も道理至極して、仰下るゝ方もなし。,"When the circumstances are reported to the Head Priest's residence, even the Retired Emperor (Hōō), though he might have reason, has no way to command."
49,1,同十六日入道相國、此日来思立給へる事なれば、関白殿を始奉て、太政大臣以下の公卿、殿上人、四十三人が官職を停て、追籠らる。,"On the same sixteenth day, because the ex-monk Governor has come to take action, starting with the Regent (Sekke), from the Chancellor down to courtiers and attendants, forty-three individuals have their positions halted and are confined."
49,2,関白殿をば、太宰帥に遷て、鎮西へ流し奉る。,"The Regent's residence is demoted to the position of Governor-General of Dazaifu, and exiled to Kyushu."
49,3,かゝらん世には、とてもかくても有なんとて、鳥羽の邊、古川と云ふ所にて、御出家有り。,"In this transient world, though things may be as they are, at the edge of Toba (Retired Emperor's residence), near Old River, there is a place where one takes refuge."
49,4,御歳三十,His age was thirty
49,5,五。,five.
49,6,礼儀能く知めし、曇なき鏡にて渡せ給ひつる者をとて、世の惜奉る事斜ならず、遠流の人の道にて出家したるをば、約束の国へは遣ぬ事である間、初は日向國と定られたりしか共、御出家の間、備前の國府の邊、井ばさまと云ふ所に留め奉る。,"Because he was one who knew etiquette well, as if crossing on a cloudless mirror (a metaphor for clarity), the world's lamentations are not without reason. Having taken the tonsure in exile, though originally destined for Hyūga Province, during his period of seclusion he is kept at Imabashi near Bizen's provincial capital."
49,7,大臣流罪の例は、左大臣蘇我赤兄、右大臣豐成、左大臣魚名、右大臣菅原、左大臣高明公、右大臣藤原伊周公に至る迄、既に六人。,"The precedent for ministerial exile includes the Left Minister Soga Akahito, Right Minister Toyomaru, Left Minister Ushio, Right Minister Sugawara, Left Minister Takamichi no Kō, and Right Minister Fujiwara no Ieyasu — already six individuals."

Rising to Senior Second Rank Minister of the Interior with imperial decree for inner audience privileges — this unprecedented advancement shocks all witnesses.

Immediately, his son, Ō no Saemon-no-jō Yasutaka, armed himself and fled hastily. Reaching Mount Inari, he dismounted, where father and son confided: 'We must retreat eastward. Though we desire to ally with Minamoto no Yoritomo, exiled in Izu for imperial censure, even his aid would prove insufficient. There are regions not under Taira control. To hide in a place familiar to us would bring shame upon our death. If summoned by Rokuhara, we shall commit seppuku.' Thus they returned to their lodging at Kawabata."
50,2,案の如く、六波羅より源大夫判官季定、攝津判官盛澄、ひた甲三百餘騎、河原坂の宿所へ押寄て、鬨をどとぞ作ける。,"As expected, from Rokuhara came Minamoto no Daijō Danjō Sadatoki, Settsu no kami Morisuke, and over three hundred fully armored horsemen, who surrounded Kawabata's lodging and raised a clamor."

For over a decade since his demotion, he lived in poverty—barely clothed for winter or summer—existing with a vacant mind until the Monk Chancellor declared: 'There is something I must convey.' Though uninvolved in affairs for years due to slander, Yukitaka grew terrified."

51,3,前右大將宗盛卿、御車を寄て、「とう／＼めさるべう候。」と奏せられければ、法皇「こはされば何事ぞや。御とがあるべし共思召さず。成親俊寛が樣に遠き國遙の島へも、遷遣んずるにこそ。主上さて渡せ給へば、政務の口入する計也。其もさるべからずば、自今以後さらでこそ有め。」と仰ければ、宗盛卿「其儀では候はず。世を靜ん程、鳥羽殿へ御幸成參せんと、父入道申候。」「さらば宗盛やがて御供に參れ。」と仰けれ共、父の禪門の気色に畏を成て、參られず。,"When Former Right Major Captain Munemori approached the imperial carriage and said, 'How shall we proceed?' the Retired Emperor replied, 'If this is done, what will come of it? I had not thought that even Tadamasa and Shigehira would be exiled to distant islands. If His Majesty were sent away, it would become a matter of intervening in governance. If this must not be done, henceforth such things shall not occur.' Upon hearing this, Munemori said, 'This is not the case.

Determined to be near His Majesty, he thought, 'By all means, I shall not let him be taken tonight. If I were to fetch his evening bathwater...'

Let us visit the past of Kanpyō and seek the ancient days of Kazan-in, abandon our homes, and renounce the world to become wandering ascetics.' When these words were spoken, the Retired Emperor replied, 'Truly lamentable. Yet if you must depart, grant me this one request. But once you have vanished without a trace, what further plea can there be? Merely ensure they report that even this foolish old man has been properly attended to.' Upon hearing this reply, the sovereign pressed his hands to his face and wept bitterly."

Yet seeing our dear companions now transformed into such ascetics—what sorrow fills my heart.

In our land, Cloistered Emperors Goshirakawa and Rokujyo ascended at three and two respectively, though they could not even tie their sashes. Even Emperor Xiaowu of Later Han ruled from birth.

Without the Daigokuden, the enthronement must be at Seiryō-den.” Thus, the ceremony occurred there."
54,39,「去じ康保四年十一月一日、冷泉院の御即位、紫宸殿にて有しは、主上御邪気に依て、大極殿へ行幸かなはざりし故也。其例如何あるべからん。只後三條院の延久の佳例に任せ、太政官の廳にて行はるべき物を。」と人々申合はれけれども、九條殿の御計の上は、左右に及ばず。,"“Formerly, in 967, the Retired Emperor’s enthronement at Seiryō-den was due to unfavorable omens preventing Daigokuden use.

The Lord of Izu responded: ""Though we possess such a steed, it has been injured through overuse and temporarily sent to the countryside. We lack the strength to retrieve it now."" Afterward, no further word was given—until many retainers of the Heike clan, lamenting the horse's fate—"

Thus they sent servants repeatedly throughout the day—five or seven times in one day alone—to plead with Nakatana. When the Third Rank heard of this, he summoned Izu: ""Even a horse worth its weight in gold deserves compassion. Send it immediately to Rokuhara."""
58,18,伊豆守力及ばで一首の歌を書そへて、六波羅へ遣す。,"Unable to comply, Izu composed a poem: ""If only you could see my longing..."" and sent it to Rokuhara."
58,19,恋くば來ても見よかし、身にそへるかげをばいかゞ放ちやるべき。,"""If you truly desire to see me, come. But do not cast aside your shadow so carelessly."""
58,20,宗盛卿、歌の返事をばし給はで、「哀馬や、馬は誠に好い馬で有けり。去ども餘に主が惜つるが憎きに、やがて主が名乘を印燒にせよ。」とて、仲綱と云ふ印燒をして、厩に立されたり。,"Lord Munemori, upon receiving the poem’s reply: ""Ah, this horse is truly splendid. Yet even as it departs, its master’s greed provokes hatred—may his name be burned to ash."" Thus Nakatana’s title was revoked, and he was confined to the stables."
58,21,客人来て「聞え候名馬を見候はばや。」と申すれば、「其仲綱めに鞍置いて引出せ。仲綱め乘れ。仲綱め打て、はれ。」など宣ひければ、伊豆守是を傳聞き、「身にかへて思ふ馬なれども、權威について取るゝだにも有に、馬故仲綱が天下の笑れ草と成んずる事こそ安からね。」と、大に憤られければ、三位入道是を聞き伊豆守に向て、「何事の有べきと思侮て、平家の人どもが、さ樣のしれ事をいふにこそ有なれ。其儀ならば、命生ても何かせん、便宜を窺ふでこそ有め。」とて、私には思も立たず、宮を勸め申けるとぞ後には聞えし。,"When guests came to see the horse, they were told: ""Bring out Nakatana with his saddle. Let him ride. Beat him!"" Upon hearing this, Izu lamented: ""Though I cherish this steed, if authority demands it—let Nakatana become a laughingstock of the realm."" Enraged, he appealed to the Third Rank: ""What madness drives these Heike scoundrels? If their schemes succeed, even death holds no meaning. Yet I will probe for advantage..."" Thus he advised the prince."
58,22,是に附ても、天下の人、小松大臣の御事をぞしのび申ける。,"And so, all men whispered of Minister Komatsu’s fate..."
58,23,或時小松殿參内の次に、中宮の御方へ参せ給ひたりけるに、八尺許有ける蛇が、大臣の指貫の左の輪を這廻りけるを、重盛騒がば、女房達も騒ぎ、中宮も驚せ給ひなんずと思召し、左の手で蛇の尾を押へ、右の手で,"One time, while Komatsu attended court and was summoned to the Empress Dowager’s presence, an eight-foot serpent coiled around his left arm cuff. Lord Shigemori panicked, attendants screamed—until he calmly pressed its tail with his left hand and—"
58,24,首を取り、直衣の袖の中に引入れ、些ともさわがず、つい立て、「六位や候、六位や候。」と召されければ、伊豆守、其時は未衞府藏人でおはしけるか、仲綱と名乘て參れたりけるに、此蛇をたぶ。,"seized its head, drew it into his kosode sleeve without a sound, and ordered: ""Call for Sixth Rank!"" At the time, Izu—serving as藏人 (court page) under the name Nakatana—arrived to slay the serpent."
58,25,給て弓場殿を経て、殿上の小庭にいでつゝ、御倉の小舎人をめして、「是給れ。」と言れければ、大に頭を掉て逃去ぬ。,"After passing through the Bow Hall, he emerged into a small courtyard and ordered a page: ""Release it."" The beast fled with its head hanging low."
58,26,力及ばず我郎等競の瀧口を召て、是を給ぶ。,"When lesser men proved unable, the 瀧口 (head of security) was summoned to handle it."
58,27,給て捨てけり。,The serpent was dispatched.
58,28,其朝小松殿善い馬に鞍置て、伊豆守の許へ遣すとて、「さても昨日の振舞こそ、優に候しか。是は乘一の馬で候。夜陰に及で陣外より、傾城の許へ通れむ時もちゐらるべし。」とて遣さる。,"The next day, Komatsu sent Nakatana a fine horse: ""Yesterday’s deed deserves praise. This steed will serve you well—even to visit courtesans under cover of night."""
58,29,伊豆守、大臣の御返事なれば、「御馬畏て賜り候ぬ。さても昨日の御振舞は、還城楽にこそ似て候しか。」とぞ申されける。,"Nakatana replied: ""I am unworthy of Your Majesty’s horse. Yet your kindness mirrors the joy of returning to the capital."""
58,30,如何なれば小松大臣は、か様にゆゆしうおはせしに、宗盛卿はさこそ無らめ、剩へ人の惜む馬乞取て、天下の大事に及ぬるこそうたてけれ。,"Thus, though Komatsu was revered, Munemori’s greed—stealing a horse others cherished—sparked events that would topple the realm."
58,31,同十六日の夜に入て、源三位入道頼政、嫡子伊豆守仲綱、次男源太夫判官兼綱、六條藏人仲家、其子藏人太郎仲光已下、都合其勢三百餘騎、館に火かけ燒上て、三井寺へこそ參られけれ。,"That same sixteenth night, the Third Rank Yoshimori Minamoto and his sons—Izu Nakatana, Michitaka (藏人), and Takahiro (太郎)—along with 300 riders, burned their quarters and rushed to Mii-dera."
58,32,三位入道の侍に、渡邊源三瀧口競と云者有り。,"Among the Third Rank’s retainers was 渡邊源三瀧口 (Watanabe Minamoto-no-Munenori), head of security."
58,33,馳後て留たりけるを、前右大將競を召て、「如何に汝は三位入道の供をばせで、留たるぞ。」と宣ば競畏て申けるは、「自然の事候はば、眞先かけて、命を奉らうとこそ日比は存て候つれども、何と思はれ候けるやらん、かうとも仰せられ候はず。」「抑朝敵頼政に同心せむとや思ふ。又是にも兼參の者ぞかし。先途後榮を存じて、當家に奉公致さんとや思ふ。有の儘に申せ。」とこそ宣ひけれ。,"When he lingered behind, Munemori demanded: ""Why delay in serving the Third Rank?"" He replied: ""I meant to lead from the front, sacrificing my life as I’ve long planned. Yet what is your intent? Do you suspect me of allying with Yoshimori? Or perhaps... seeking advancement through cunning means? I will serve honestly."""
58,34,競涙をはら／＼と流いて、「相傳の好はさる事で候へ共、いかが朝敵となれる人に同心をばし候べき。,"Tears streaming, he lamented: ""Though tradition demands loyalty—how can I ally with the enemy of the court..."""

58,39,漸日も暮ければ、大將出られたり。,"As night fell, the general departed."
58,40,競畏て申けるは、「誠や三位入道殿三井寺にと聞え候。定めて討手向けられ候はんずらん。心にくうも候はず。三井寺法師、さては渡邊のしたしい奴原こそ候らめ。擇討などもし候べきに、乘て事にあふべき馬の候つるを、親い奴めに盗まれて候。御馬一匹下し預るべうや候らん。」と申すれば、大將尤さるべしとて、白葦毛なる馬の煖廷とて秘藏せられたりけるに、好い鞍置てぞ給だりける。,"Nakatana feared: ""The Third Rank has fled to Mii-dera, likely facing pursuit. We must prepare for battle—but our finest horse, Warm Court, was stolen by a trusted servant! May we borrow one steed?"" Moved, the general retrieved a snow-white stallion and its fine saddle."
58,41,競屋形に歸て、「早日の暮よかし、此馬に打乘て、三井寺へ馳參り、三位入道殿の眞先かけて、打死せん。」とぞ申ける。,"""Night falls quickly,"" Nakatana declared. ""I ride now to Mii-dera, leading the charge for the Third Rank."""

58,50,三井寺には、折節競が沙汰ありけり。,"At Mii-dera, rumors swirled of Nakatana’s valor."
58,51,渡邊黨「競をば召具すべう候つる者を、六波羅に殘り留まて、いかなるうき目にか逢ひ候らん。」と申すれば、三位入道心を知て「よも其者、無體に囚へ搦られはせじ。入道に志深い者也今見よ。唯今參うずるぞ。」と宣も果ねば、競つと出來たり。,"""Those summoned to detain Nakatana remain at Rokuhara,"" Izu declared.

58,55,大將急ぎ出て見給ふに、「昔は煖廷、今は平宗盛入道」と云ふ印燒をぞしたりける。,"The general rushed out—and saw the seal: ""Warm Court, now the Monk of Heike Munemori."""
58,56,大將「安からぬ。競めを手延にしてたばかられぬる事こそ遺恨なれ。今度三井寺へ寄たらんに、如何にもして先づ競めを生捕にせよ。鋸で頸斬ん。」とて、躍上々々怒られけれども、煖廷が尾髪を生ず、印燒も又失ざりけり。,"""Catastrophe!"" The general ordered: ""Lash Munenori and hang him! When attacking Mii-dera, capture him alive—behead with a saw."" Yet Warm Court’s mane flowed freely; the seal vanished again."

59,1,近日世上の體を案ずるに、佛法の衰微、王法の牢籠正に此時に當れり。,"'Considering the state of the world recently, it is indeed at this time that Buddhism declines and secular law decays.'"
59,2,今度清盛入道が暴惡を戒めずば、何の日をか期すべき。,"'If Nyudo Kiyomori does not reprimand his wickedness this time, on what day shall we await the judgment?'"
59,3,宮此に入御の御事、正八幡宮の衞護、新羅大明神の冥助に非ずや。,'Is not the imperial presence here safeguarded by Shōhachiman Shrine and aided spiritually by Shirataki Myojin?'
59,4,天衆地類も影向を垂れ、佛力神力も降伏を加へ坐す事などか無るべき。,'Even heavenly and earthly beings manifest their influence; the power of Buddhas and gods bestows subjugation—such a thing should not exist.'

59,7,処に、などか與せざるべき。,such matters should not be conceded.
59,8,と、たち同心に僉議して、山へも奈良へも、牒状をこそ遣しけれ。,They resolved in unison after deliberation and thus sent official letters to the mountain temples and Nara.
59,9,先山門への状に云、治承四年五月十八日　大衆等とぞ書たりける。,"The prior letter to the mountain gate states: 'On Jishō four [1180], May 18th, the assembly has written this.'"

60,1,又車の二つの輪に似たりと、抑て書く條、奇怪なり。,"Again, it is written as if likened to the two wheels of a carriage, yet this is strange."
60,2,」とて、返牒を送らず。,"Thus, they sent no response."
60,3,其上入道相國天台座主明雲大僧正に、衆徒を靜らるべき由宣ければ、座主急ぎ登山して、大衆をしづめ給ふ。,"Furthermore, when it was announced to Retired Emperor/Taisho Master Myoun Daisojo that the assembly should be pacified, the master hastily ascended the mountain and quieted the crowd."
60,4,かゝりし間、宮の御方へ、不定の由をぞ申ける。,"In the meantime, they reported some indefinite matter to His Majesty's side."
60,5,又入道相國、近江米二萬石、北國の織延絹三千匹、往往来に寄らる。,"Moreover, the Retired Emperor donated 20,000 koku of rice from Omi Province and 3,000 bolts of silk from northern countries towards the cause."
60,6,是を谷々嶺々に引れけるに、俄の事では有り、一人して數多を取る大衆も有り。,"When these were distributed to various valleys and peaks, it happened suddenly that there were those among the crowd who took many for themselves."
60,7,又手を空うして、一つも取ぬ衆徒も有り。,"Others kept their hands empty, taking nothing at all."
60,8,何者の爲態にや有けん、落書をぞしたりける。,What manner of conduct could have been such that they composed a letter of complaint?
60,9,山法師織延衣うすくして、恥をばえこそかくさざりけれ。,"The mountain priests, with their thin robes, could not help but be ashamed to conceal them."
60,10,又絹にもあたらぬ大衆の詠したりけるやらん。,"And those among the crowd who had no silk at all, they too composed verses."
60,11,織延を一きれも得ぬわれらさへ、薄恥をかくかずに入哉。,"Even though we ourselves received not a single bolt of silk, we entered without any sense of shame."
60,12,又南都への状に云、治承四年五月十八日　大衆等とぞ書たりける。,"Furthermore, in the document sent to Nanto, it is written: 'May 18th, Tensho four, by the assembly.'"
60,13,南都の大衆此状を披見して、やがて返牒を送る。,"The great assembly of Nanto, upon reading this matter, promptly sent a reply."
60,14,其返牒に云、治承四年五月二十一日　大衆等とぞ書たりける。,"In that response, it is written: 'May 21st, Tensho four, by the assembly.'"
61,0,三井寺には又大衆起て僉議す。,"At Mii-dera, a large assembly has gathered again for consultation."
61,1,山門は心替しつ、南都は未參らず。,"The mountain gate [Enryaku-ji] has changed its resolve, while Nanto [Nara] has yet to participate."
61,2,此事延ては惡かりけん。,"This matter, if prolonged, will surely turn out badly."

61,9,縱さも候へ。,Even if so.
61,10,いかゞ衆徒の義をやぶり、我寺の名をも惜では候ふべき。,To break the oath of our followers and not even cherish the name of our temple would be unseemly.

Clutching a white-hilted long staff wrapped in cloth, he stepped into the assembly and declared: 'We must not reveal our plans externally. Our temple's founding vow dates to Emperor Tenmu, who sent Prince Ōtomo with only seventeen men to traverse the Ogi of Yoshino, pass through Iga and Ise, defeat forces in Mino and Owari, and secure his ascension. The text says: ""A desperate bird enters the bosom; humanity weeps for such acts."" Though I know not the rest, among my disciples at Keishū's school, let us tonight attack Rokuhara and crush them!'"

Muen-in-dono Taifu Minamoto no Saku then recounted: 'When King Zhao of Qin imprisoned Lord Mengchang, thanks to the Empress's aid, 3,000 soldiers escaped via Hangu Pass. The gate wouldn't open until cocks crowed. Among Meng's retainers was a specialist called 天cut who mimicked roosters. Climbing high places, they replicated cock crows so effectively that all chickens along the pass began crowing simultaneously. Deceived by this sonic deception, the guards opened the gates.'"

62,15,同廿三日の曉、宮は此の寺ばかりでは叶ふまじ、山門は心替し、南都は未參らず。,"On the morning of the 23rd, the court realized Mii-dera's fall alone wouldn't suffice. The temple gates had been compromised and Nanto (Nara) showed no signs of mobilizing."
62,16,後日に成ては惡かりなんとて、三井寺を出させ給ひて、南都へぞ入せ座ます。,"Ultimately, the emperor ordered Mii-dera's evacuation and permitted entry to Nanto."
62,17,此宮は蝉折、小枝と聞えし漢竹の笛を二つ持せ給へり。,"The imperial procession carried two special bamboo flutes named Semitsuke and Kobuchi, crafted from Chinese bamboo."
62,18,彼蝉折と申は、昔鳥羽院の御時金を千兩、宋朝の御門へ、送らせ給ひたりければ、返報と覺くて、生たる蝉の如くに、節の附たる笛竹を、一節贈らせ給ふ。,"Semitsuke's origin: During Emperor Toba's reign, when 1,000 ryo were sent to the Song Dynasty court as tribute, they received in return a bamboo with live cicadas attached - hence the name meaning 'cicada-breaking'."
62,19,如何が是程の重寶をば左右なうはゑらすべきとて、三井寺の大進僧正覺宗に仰せて、壇上に立て、七日加持して、彫せ給へる御笛也。,"This precious gift was entrusted to Mii-dera's Daisen Sojo Kakuzo, who consecrated it for seven days on the altar before crafting the imperial flutes."
62,20,或時高松中納言實平卿參て、此御笛を吹れけるに、尋常の笛の樣に思忘て、膝より下に置れたりければ、笛や尤けん、其時蝉折にけり。,"Once, when Middle Counselor Takamatsu-no-kami Sanpei played the flute, he carelessly placed it below his knees. As if alive, the Semitsuke suddenly snapped."
62,21,さてこそ蝉折とは付られたれ。,Thus earning its name 'Semitsuke' (cicada-breaker).
62,22,笛の御器量たるに依て、此宮御相傳有けり。,"Due to the flutes' sacred status, they were imperial heirlooms."
62,23,されども今を限とや思食れけん、金堂の彌勒に參らさせおはします。,"However, facing impending ruin, the court ordered them to pay final respects at Kondo's Miroku Buddha statue."
62,24,龍華の曉、値遇の御爲かと覺えて、哀也し事共なり。,"On the morning of the Dragon Flower Festival, realizing their final hour had come, all felt profound sorrow."
62,25,老僧共には皆暇賜で、留めさせ坐ます。,The elderly priests were granted clemency and allowed to remain.
62,26,しかるべき若大衆惡僧共は參りけり。,"But the young, unruly monks gathered as well."
62,27,源三位入道の一類引具して、其勢一千人とぞ聞えし。,Minamoto no Sanmi Inudou led his contingent of a thousand men.
62,28,乘圓房阿闍梨慶秀、鳩の杖にすがりて、宮の御前に參り、老眼より涙をはら／＼と流して申けるは、「何迄も御供仕べう候へ共、齡既に八旬にたけて、行歩叶ひがたう候。,"Priest Myoren-bo Keshu leaned on a pigeon-decorated staff, weeping before the emperor: 'Though eager to serve Your Majesty, at eighty years old my steps are too slow.'"
62,29,弟子で候刑部房俊秀を參らせ候。,'Please allow my disciple Hyobu-no-bo Yoshitaka to serve instead.'
62,30,是は一年平治の合戰の時、故左馬頭義朝が手に候ひて、六條河原で討死仕り候し相摸國住人山内須藤刑部丞俊通が子で候。,"Yoshitaka was the son of Sando-no-suke Yukinobu, a resident of Sagami Province who died fighting at Rokujo-gawara under late Saemon-no-kami Yoshikane during the Heiji Conflict."
62,31,いさゝか縁候間、跡懷でおほしたてて、心の底迄能知て候。,"Having served since childhood, I know his legacy deeply.'"
62,32,何迄も召具せられ候べし。,'I must be summoned to serve!'
62,33,」とて、涙を抑て留りぬ。,"' With tears held back, he remained."
62,34,宮もあはれに思召て、何の好にかうは申らんとて、御涙せきあへさせ給はず。,"The emperor, moved by compassion, could find no kind words to refuse, his tears flowing freely."
63,0,宮は宇治と寺との間にて、六度迄御落馬有けり。,The Imperial Prince fell from his horse six times between Uji and the temple.
63,1,これは去ぬる夜、御寢の成ざりし故也とて、宇治橋三間引きはづし、平等院に入奉て、暫御休息有けり。,"This was because on a previous night, His Majesty had not rested in bed. He drew back three spans of Uji Bridge and entered Byodo-in for temporary respite."
63,2,六波羅には、「すはや宮こそ南都へ落させ給ふなれ。追懸て討奉れ。」とて、大將軍には左兵衞督知盛、頭中將重衡、左馬頭行盛、薩摩守忠教、侍大將には、上總守忠清、其子上總太郎判官忠綱、飛騨守景家、其子飛騨太郎判官景高、高橋判官長綱、河内判官秀國、武蔵三郎左衞門尉有国、越中次郎兵衛尉盛繼、上總五郎兵衛忠光、惡七兵衞景清を先として、都合其勢二萬八千餘騎、木幡山打越て、宇治橋の詰にぞ押寄たる。,"In Rokuhara, orders were given: 'Hasten to defeat the Imperial Prince and drive him south! Pursue and slay him!' Led by Major General Minamoto no Yoshitsune (Left Bureau Captain), Middle Captain Tadahiro, Master of Horse Yukimori, Satsuma Governor Tadamasa, and Court Attendant Tadakata, along with other commanders—Upper-Total Governor Tadakazu, his son Upper-Total太郎判官忠綱, Hida Governor Kageyoshi, his son Hida太郎判官景高, Tajima Judge Nagatsuna, Kawachi Judge Hidekuni, Musashi Third郎左衛門尉有国, Echigo Second郎兵衛尉盛繼, Upper-Total Fifth郎兵衛忠光, and Aku Seven郎兵衞景清—the combined force of 28,000+ cavalry crossed Mount Makimata and pressed forward to Uji Bridge."
63,3,敵平等院にと見てんげれば、閧を作る事三箇度、宮の御方にも、同う閧の聲をぞ合せたる。,"When the enemy made clamor toward Byodo-in three times, His Majesty's side matched their shouts in unison."
63,4,先陣が、「橋を引いたぞ、過すな。」とどよみけれども、後陣に是を聞つけず、我先にと進程に、先陣二百餘騎押落され、水に溺れて流けり。,"The vanguard cried, 'Retreat the bridge! Do not cross!' But the rear did not hear. Charging forward recklessly, over two hundred horses of the vanguard were thrown into the water and swept away."
63,5,橋の兩方の詰に打立て矢合す。,Arrows clashed from both ends of the bridge.
63,6,宮の御方には、大矢俊長、五智院但馬、渡邊省授、續源太が射ける矢ぞ鎧もかけず楯もたまらず通ける。,"From His Majesty's side, the arrows of Taiga Shunnojo, Gocho Butsuma, Watanabe Shojo, and Zutsu Genzo pierced armor and shields alike."
63,7,源三位入道は、長絹の鎧直垂に、品皮威の鎧也。,"The Third Rank Minamoto Priest wore a long-sleeved cuirass of silk brocade, its surface adorned with protective metal plates."
63,8,其日を最後とや思はれ,That day was deemed the final battle
63,9,けん。,Indeed.
63,10,態と甲は著給はず。,He neither adjusted his posture nor donned armor.
63,11,嫡子伊豆守仲綱は、赤地の錦の直垂に、黒絲威の鎧也。,"His heir, Izu Governor Tadatane, wore a crimson brocade surcoat and armor reinforced with black cord."
63,12,弓を強う引んとて是も甲は著ざりけり。,"Likewise, he refused to wear armor despite his skill in archery."
63,13,爰に五智院但馬、大長刀の鞘を外いて、唯一人橋の上にぞ進んだる。,Gocho Butsuma unsheathed his longsword and charged alone onto the bridge.
63,14,平家の方には是を見て、「あれ射取や者共」とて究竟の弓の上手共が矢先を汰へて差詰引詰散々に射る。,"Seeing this, the Heike forces cried, 'That man must be killed!' Their elite archers showered him with volleys of arrows."
63,15,但馬少しも噪がず、揚る矢をばつい潜り、下る矢をば跳り越え、向て來をば長刀で切て落す。,"Butsuma remained calm, ducking ascending arrows and leaping over descending ones. He sliced down those who approached with his longsword."
63,16,敵も御方も見物す。,Both enemy and allies watched in awe.
63,17,其よりしてこそ、矢切の但馬とは云はれけれ。,Thus he earned the name 'Butsuma of Arrow-Cutting.'
63,18,堂衆の中に、筒井の淨妙明秀は、褐の直垂に、黒革威の鎧著て、五枚甲の緒をしめ、黒漆の太刀を帯き、二十四差たる黒ほろの矢負ひ、塗籠籐の弓に、好む白柄の大長刀取副て、橋の上にぞ進んだる。,"Among the temple attendants, Jomyo Myoshin of Tachibana wore a brown surcoat and black-leather armor. He fastened his five-layered cuirass, carried a lacquered sword, bore twenty-four black-fletched arrows in his quiver, wielded a painted bamboo bow, and advanced onto the bridge with his preferred white-hilted longsword."
63,19,大音聲を揚て名のりけるは「日來は音にも聞きつらむ、今は目にも見給へ。三井寺には其隱れ無し。堂衆の中に筒井淨妙明秀とて、一人当千の兵ぞや。我と思はむ人々は寄合や、見參せむ。」とて、二十四差たる矢を差詰引詰散々に射る。,"He shouted his battle cry: 'Hitherto you have heard my name, but now see me! Mii-dera has no secrets. In our midst stands Jomyo Myoshin of Tachibana—a single warrior worth a thousand soldiers! Come gather to witness!' He unleashed all twenty-four arrows in rapid succession."
63,20,矢庭に十二人射殺して、十一人手負せたれば、箙に一つぞ殘たる。,"Twelve enemy archers fell dead, eleven more were wounded. Only one arrow remained in his quiver."
63,21,弓をばからと投捨て、箙も解て捨てけり。,"He discarded his bow and emptied his quiver, casting them aside."
63,22,つらぬき脱で跣に成り、橋の行桁をさら／＼と走渡る。,"Stripping to his loincloth and barefoot, he raced across the bridge's planks."
63,23,人は恐れて渡らねども、淨妙房が心地には、一條二條の大路とこそ振舞たれ。,"Though others dared not cross, Jomyo moved as if treading broad roads."
63,24,長刀で向ふ敵五人薙ふせ、六人に當る敵に逢て、長刀中より打折て捨てけり。,"He cleaved five attackers with his longsword, then broke it against a sixth opponent and discarded the weapon."
63,25,其後太刀を拔て戰ふに、敵は大勢なり、蜘蛛手、角繩、十文字、蜻蜒返り、水車、八方透さず切たりけり。,"Drawing a new sword, he fought through overwhelming numbers, employing techniques: 'Spider-hand grip,' 'Horn-rope strike,' 'Cross-cut,' 'Dragonfly-return,' 'Waterwheel slash,' and 'Omni-piercing cut.'"
63,26,矢庭に八人切ふせ、九人に當る敵が甲の鉢に、餘に強う打當て、目貫の元よりちやうと折れ、くと拔て、河へざぶと入にけり。,"He felled eight more with his sword. Against a ninth opponent, a powerful blow shattered his helmet's visor. He pulled out the blade and plunged into the river."
63,27,憑む所は腰刀、偏へに死なんとぞ狂ける。,"Clutching his dagger, he swam furiously downstream toward certain death."
63,28,爰に乗圓房阿闍梨慶秀が召使ける一來法師と云ふ大力の早態在けり。,"There, Priest Joen of Joryu Temple—a powerful monk named Ichikai-bo—waited with his retinue."
63,29,續て後に戰ふが、行桁は狹し、側通べき樣はなし。,"In the subsequent battle, the bridge's narrow planks offered no room to maneuver."
63,30,淨妙房が甲の手さきに手を置て、「惡う候、淨妙房」とて、肩をつんで跳り越てぞ戰ひける。,"Jomyo braced his hand on the armor's shoulder guard. 'Wretched Jomyo!' he cried, leaping over the rail to continue fighting."
63,31,一來法師打死してんげり。,He killed Ichikai-bo in single combat.
63,32,淨妙房は這々歸て、平等院の門の前なる芝の上に物具脱捨て、鎧に立たる矢目を數へたりければ六十三、裏掻く矢五所、され共大事の手ならねば、所々に灸治して、首からげ淨衣著て、弓打切り杖に突き、平あしたはき、阿彌陀佛申て、奈良の方へぞ罷ける。,"Jomyo returned, discarded his gear at Byodo-in's gate, counted sixty-three arrow holes in his armor, treated five deep wounds with cautery, wrapped his head in a priest's robe, and departed toward Nara reciting the Buddha's name."
63,33,淨妙房が渡るを手本にして、三井寺の大衆、渡邊黨走續々々、我も／＼と行桁をこそ渡けれ。,"Following Jomyo's example, Mii-dera's monks scrambled across the bridge in chaotic waves."
63,34,或は分取して歸る者も有り、或は痛手負て、腹掻切り川へ飛入る者もあり、橋の上の戰、火いづる程ぞ戰ひける。,"Some retreated, others fell into the river with fatal wounds. The bridge battle raged fiercely, like flames consuming everything."
63,35,是を見て平家の方の侍大將上總守忠清、大將軍の御前に參て、「あれ御覽候へ。橋の上の戰、手痛う候。今は川を渡すべきで候が、折節五月雨の比で、水まさて候。渡さば馬人多く亡候なんず。淀芋洗へや向ひ候べき、河内路へや參り候べき。」と申處に下野國の住人、足利又太郎忠綱、進出て申けるは、「淀芋洗河内路をば、天竺震旦の武士を召て向けられ候はんずるか。,"Seeing this, Upper-Total Governor Tadakazu of the Heike approached his general: 'Please observe. The bridge battle is costly. With the water swollen like May rains, crossing would drown many horses. We should retreat to淀芋洗 or approach via Kawachi Road.' From among the crowd stepped Azuma no Moritane Tadatane of Shimotsuke Province: 'Would you suggest that Indian or Chinese warriors guard these routes?'"
63,36,其も我らこそ向ひ候はんずれ。,"No, we ourselves shall go forward.'"
63,37,目に懸たる敵を討ずして南都へ入參せ候なば、吉野とつ川の勢共馳集て、弥御大事でこそ候はんずらめ。,"If we do not first slay the visible enemy before entering Nara, the forces of Yoshino and Tsutsui will converge upon us, surely causing disaster.'"
63,38,武蔵と上野の境に、利根川と申大河候。,Between Musashi and Kozuke provinces lies the great River Tone.
63,39,秩父、足利、中違て、常は合戰を爲候しに、大手は長井渡、搦手は古我杉渡より寄せ候ひしに、爰に上野國の住人、新田入道、足利に語はれて、杉の渡より寄んとて儲たる舟共を秩父が方より皆破れて、申候しは、「唯今爰を渡さずば、長き弓箭の疵なるべし。,"Between Saitama and Azuma, battles were traditionally fought. The main force would cross at Nagaiwataru, the flanking attack through Gotamasugiwataru. However, when New田入道 (a priest of New田) advised Azuma to attack from Gotamasugiwataru, the ships prepared by Saitama forces were all destroyed. He declared: 'Unless we cross now, our longbows will become useless.'"
63,40,水に溺れて死なば死ね、いざ渡さんとて、馬筏を作て渡せばこそ渡しけめ。,"Let us die drowning if we must, but cross at once! Build horse rafts to ford!'"
63,41,坂東武者の習として、敵を目にかけ、川を隔つる軍に、淵瀬嫌ふ様や有る。,This was the custom of Kanto warriors: to confront visible enemies rather than avoid river barriers.
63,42,此河の深さ、早さ、利根河に幾程の劣り勝りはよもあらじ。,This river's depth and swiftness surpass Tone River in both respects.
63,43,續けや殿原。,"Continue, Lord Hojo!"
63,44,」とて、眞先にこそ打入たれ。,"With these words, they charged forward."
63,45,續く人共、大胡、大室、深須、山上、那波太郎、佐貫廣綱四郎大夫、小野寺前司太郎、邊屋子四郎、郎等には宇夫方次郎、切生六郎、田中宗太を始として、三百餘騎ぞ續ける。,"Following them came three hundred riders: Ōgo, Ōmuro, Fukushi, Yamanaka, Nawa no太郎, Sōgane Hironobu Shiro-daijin, Onodera Zenji Taro, Kegare no四郎, and others including Ubusuma no Sukemasa, Kiribe Rokurō, and Tanaka Munetora."
63,46,足利大音聲を揚て、「強き馬をば上手に立てゝ、弱き馬をば下手になせ。馬の足の及ばう程は、手綱をくれて歩せよ。はづまばかい操て泳せよ。下う者をば弓の弭に取附せよ。手を取組み、肩を竝て渡すべし。鞍壺に能く乘定めて、鐙を強う踏め。馬の頭沈まば、引揚よ。痛う引て引被くな。水溜まば、三頭の上に乘懸れ。馬には弱う、水には強う中べし。河中にて弓引な。敵射共相引すな。常に錣を傾よ。痛う傾て天邊射さすな。かねに渡て推落さるな。水にしなうて渡せや渡せ。」と掟て、三百餘騎、一騎も流さず、向の岸へ颯と渡す。,"Azuma raised his voice: 'Place strong horses in front, weak ones behind. Where the current permits, ride while holding reins; where not, swim with bridles. Use bow nocks to buoy weaker riders. Grapple and shoulder each other across. Secure stirrups firmly, press down on stirrup irons. If a horse sinks, pull him up! Swim hard, don't cling! In eddies, position three abreast. Though horses falter, water is our ally. Do not draw bows mid-river. Let enemy archers draw first. Always tilt your spears downward. Don't lean too far to shoot the heavens. Cross together and push forward!' Following these orders, the 300 riders crossed without loss."
64,0,足利は、朽葉の綾の直垂に、赤革威の鎧著て、高角打たる甲の緒をしめ、金作の太刀を帯き、切斑の矢負ひ、重籐の弓持て、連錢蘆毛なる馬に、柏木にみゝづく打たる金覆輪の鞍置てぞ乘たりける。,"Ashikaga, wearing a straight-sleeved robe of朽叶-colored striped fabric, donned crimson leather armor, fastened the cord of his tall helmet, carried a gold-crafted sword, shouldered arrows with cut patterns, held a heavy bamboo bow, and rode a horse with芦毛 (reed-colored) coat adorned with a saddle of柏木 (cypress wood) fitted with gilt stirrups."
64,1,鐙踏張り立上り、大音聲を揚て、名乘れるは、「遠くは音にも聞き、近くは目にも見給へ。,"The stirrups were raised high, a thunderous sound resounded, and he proclaimed: 'From afar, one may hear the sound; up close, one may behold it with their eyes.'"
64,2,昔朝敵將門を亡し、勸賞蒙し俵藤太秀里に十代、足利太郎俊綱が子、又太郎忠,"Long ago, when Ashikaga Taro Shigetsuna's son, the second heir忠, avenged the morning enemy generals and received commendation from 俵藤太秀里 (Taira no Toshimichi), ten generations had passed."
64,3,綱、生年十七歳、か樣に無官無位なる者の、宮に向ひ参せて、弓を引き矢を放つ事天の恐少からず候へ共、弓も矢も冥加の程も、平家の御上にこそ候らめ。,"Though 綱 was only seventeen, this man of no official rank or title was summoned to the Imperial Court. Though his archery was fearsome even to Heaven, both bow and arrow relied on divine favor—not under the Taira clan's authority."
64,4,三位入道殿の御方に、我と思はん人々は、寄合や見参せん。,"To the Third-Rank Priest (Dainagon), those who believed in me should gather and present themselves."
64,5,」とて平等院の門の内へ責入々々戦けり。,"Thus, they repeatedly charged into the inner gate of Byodo-in for battle."
64,6,此を見給て、大將軍左兵衛督知盛、「渡せや渡せ。」と下知せられければ、二萬八千餘騎、皆打入て渡しけり。,"Upon witnessing this, the Great General Sahei Shosho Kiyomori issued orders: 'Cross! Cross!' With 28,000 cavalry charging into the river."
64,7,馬や人に塞られて、さばかり早き宇治川の、水は上にぞ湛へたる。,"Horses and men blocked the swift Uji River, causing its waters to rise."
64,8,自ら外るゝ水には、何も不堪流れけり。,The overflowed waters swept away all who dared oppose their flow.
64,9,雑人共は、馬の下手に取附々々渡りければ、膝より上をば濡さぬ者も多かりけり。,"Commoners clung to horses' hindquarters, many escaping wetness above the knees."
64,10,如何したりけん伊賀伊勢兩國の官兵、馬筏押破られ水に溺れて六百餘騎ぞ流れける。,"Soldiers from Iga and Ise provinces, their horse rafts shattered by the current, drowned 600+ riders."
64,11,萠黄、緋威、赤威、色々の鎧の浮ぬ沈ぬゆられけるは、神南備山の紅葉葉の、嶺の嵐に誘れて、龍田河の秋の暮、井塞に懸て、流もやらぬに異ならず。,"The bobbing and sinking of lime-green, crimson, and red armor resembled autumn leaves in a storm on the slopes of Mount Kono, like willows along the Katsura River's evening current—untouched by flow or stillness."
64,12,其中に緋威の鎧著たる武者が三人、網代に流れ懸て淘けるを、伊豆守見給ひて、伊勢武者はみなひおどしの鎧きて、宇治の網代にかゝりぬるかな。,"Among them, three crimson-armored warriors tangled in fishing nets caught the eye of Izu no kami (Governor of Izu), who recognized their elite Ise province gear adorning Uji's net-rafts."
64,13,是等は三人ながら伊勢國の住人也。,These three were natives of Ise Province.
64,14,黒田後平四郎、日野十郎、乙部彌七と云ふ者なり。,"Known as Kuroda Gokei Shiro, Hino Juro, and Otobe Mitsu."
64,15,其中に日野十郎は、ふる者にて有ければ、弓の弭を岩の狹間にねぢ立て、掻上り、二人の者どもをも引上て、助たりけるとぞ聞えし。,"Hino Juro, an old warrior, once wedged his arrowhead between rocks, scaled them, and pulled up two comrades—his legendary feat recounted."
64,16,大勢みな渡して、平等院の門の内へ、入替／＼戦ひけり。,"The masses crossed into Byodo-in's inner gate, fighting in shifts."
64,17,此の紛に、宮をば南都へ先立て参せ、源三位入道の一類、残て防矢射給ふ。,"Amidst the chaos, the Prince was sent ahead to Nanto (Nara), while Third-Rank Priest Minamoto's retinue remained to repel archers."
64,18,三位入道七十に餘て軍して、弓手の膝口を射させ、痛手なれば、心靜かに自害せんとて、平等院の門の内へ引退いて、敵おそひかゝりければ、次男源大夫判官兼綱、紺地の錦の直垂に、,"Though aged seventy, the priest commanded troops to target archers' knees. After sustaining grievous wounds, he calmly retreated into Byodo-in's gate, where his second son, Minamoto no Kanetsune (Junior Counselor), clad in indigo brocade, prepared to defend."
64,19,唐綾威の鎧著て、白葦毛なる馬に乘り、父を延さんと、返合せ／＼防戰ふ。,"Wearing Chinese-patterned crimson armor atop a white芦苇-coated horse, he fought to prolong his father's life."
64,20,上総太郎判官が射ける矢に兼綱内甲を射させて疼む處に、上總守が童、次郎丸と云ふしたゝか者押竝て引組でどうと落つ。,"When Uchisaki no Taisho's arrow pierced Kanetsune's inner armor, his son Sousou no Sukemaru (Second Lord) seized the opportunity to grapple and throw him."
64,21,源大夫判官は、内甲も痛手なれども、聞る大力なりければ、童を取て押て頸を掻き、立上らんとする處に、平家の兵共、十四五騎ひし／＼と落重て、兼綱を討てけり。,"Though wounded, Kanetsune's strength was legendary—he grabbed the boy, pressed his neck, and prepared to rise. But Taira riders surrounded him with 14 horses, overwhelming and slaying him."
64,22,伊豆守仲綱も、痛手あまた負ひ平等院の釣殿にて自害す。,"Governor of Izu, Naotane, mortally wounded, committed seppuku in Byodo-in's fishing pavilion."
64,23,其頸をば下河邊藤三郎清親取て、大床の下へぞ投入ける。,His severed head was seized by 下河辺藤三郎 Kiyomochi and thrown into a large well.
64,24,六條藏人仲家、其子藏人太郎仲光も、散々に戰ひ、分捕餘たして、遂に討死してけり。,"Sixtouro no Naokane and his son, Sixtaro no Nobufumi, fought valiantly until captured and slain."
64,25,此仲家と申は、故帶刀先生義方が嫡子也。,Naokane was the legitimate heir of the late 帶刀先生 (sword-bearer) Yoshimasa.
64,26,孤にて有しを、三位入道養子にして、不便にし給しが、日來の契を変ぜず、一所にて死にけるこそ無慚なれ。,"Raised as the Third-Rank Priest's adopted son despite his lineage, he died unashamedly in battle."
64,27,三位入道は渡邊長七唱を召て、「我頸うて。」と宣へば、主の生頸討ん事の悲しさに、涙をはらはらと流して、「仕るとも覺え候はず。御自害候て、其後こそ給り候はめ。」と申すれば、「誠にも。」とて西に向ひ、高聲に十念唱へ最後の詞ぞあはれなる。,"The priest summoned Watanabe Nagashichi and wept: 'Strike my neck.' After his lord's death, he chanted the last verse of the Nembutsu prayer to the west."
64,28,埋木の花さく事もなかりしに、みのなる果ぞかなしかりける。,"Though the buried tree never bloomed, its fruit was sweet indeed."
64,29,是を最後の詞にて、太刀のさきを腹に突立て、俯様に貫てぞ失られける。,"With this final prayer, he thrust his sword into his abdomen and perished."
64,30,其時に歌讀べうは無りしか共、若より強に好たる道なれば、最後の時も忘れ給はず。,"Though no song was sung, his profound devotion to the Way meant he would not forget even at death's door."
64,31,其頸をば唱取て泣々石に括合せ敵の中を紛れ出て、宇治川の深き所に沈てけり。,"His head, bound by chanters and weeping, was lost in the Uji River's depths."
64,32,競瀧口をば平家の侍共、如何にもして、生捕にせんとうかゞひけれ共、競も先に心えて、散散に戰ひ、大事の手負ひ、腹掻切てぞ死にける。,"At the rapids' mouth, Taira warriors attempted to capture prisoners but were themselves overwhelmed, sustaining fatal abdominal wounds."
64,33,圓滿院大輔源覺、今は宮も遙に延させ給ひ,"Ganden'in no Daibu Minamoto no Saku, now seeing the Prince's distant fate..."
64,34,ぬらんとや思ひけん。,...mused pensively.
64,35,大太刀大長刀左右に持て、敵の中をうち破り、宇治川へ飛で入り、物具一つも捨ず、水の底を潜て、向の岸に渡り著き、高き所に登り、大音聲を揚て、「如何に平家の君達、是までは御大事かよう。」とて、三井寺へこそ歸けれ。,"Wielding great swords, he burst through enemy lines into the Uji River, submerged to the other shore, climbed high ground, and roared: 'Thus ends the Taira's might!' before retreating to Mii-dera."

Granting Hachiman's sword to Yoritomo aligns with divine will. Kasuga's decree about descendants shall hold. When the Taira fall and Minamoto rule ends, a descendant of 大織冠 (the Great Crown Prince) from powerful lineages shall become Shogun.'"

Subsequently, with three hundred odd horsemen from Toida, Doi, and Okazaki gathering at Ishibashiyama where they entrenched themselves, Kageshige led over a thousand warriors sharing the same resolve to press forward. However, they were overwhelmed by Yoritomo's seven mounted retainers in battle, suffering heavy casualties before retreating to Sugiyama of Toida. Later, five hundred Hojo cavalry came to serve Yoritomo. The sons of Masaaki Miura Jōmyō with three hundred horsemen joining Minamoto forces fought at Uji Kobegaura Bay but were forced by Hojo troops to withdraw to Musashi Province. Subsequently, the Hojo clan mobilized over three thousand warriors from seven branches including Kawagoe, Inba, Oyamada, Edo, and Kasedo along with other allies to attack Miura's Yashikake Castle. Masaaki was slain in battle. His children escaped by boat from Kurahama Bay to cross into Awa and Kazusa provinces.'"

Had he been properly informed, surely he would have acted. These others - they have always served the enemy court. Now we hear demands for reconsideration.' Some agreed saying 'Truly so,' while many whispered objections: 'But this concerns matters of state!'"

Give me your head, and I will present it to the emperor. When he rejoices in viewing it, I shall draw my sword and pierce his heart.' Upon hearing this, Fan Wuji leaped up, sigheding deeply: 'Since my father, uncles, and brothers were executed by the emperor, I have suffered endlessly day and night. To kill him, offering my head is easier than sweeping dust.' He severed his own head with his hands."

74,3,十九の年道心発し出家して、修行にいでんとしけるが、「修行といふは、いか程の大事やらん、試いて見ん。」とて、六月の日の草もゆるがず光たるに、片山の藪の中に這いり、仰のけに伏し、虻ぞ、蚊ぞ、蜂蟻など云ふ毒蟲共が身にひしと取附て螫食などしけれども、ちとも身をも動かさず、七日迄は起上らず。,"At nineteen, he developed religious resolve and left home for ascetic practice. Determined to test the true rigor of 'asceticism,' he crawled into a thicket on Mount Katayama under the summer sun, lying prone with arms outstretched. Though swarmed by flies, mosquitoes, wasps, and ants that bit and stung him relentlessly, he remained motionless for seven days without rising."
74,4,八日と云ふに起上て、「修行と云ふは、是程の大事か。」と人に問へば、「其程ならんには、爭か命も生べき。」と言ふ間、「さては安平ごさんなれ。」とて、軈て修行にぞ出にける。,"On the eighth day, rising to ask: 'Is asceticism truly such a great undertaking?' When told: 'If you would attain it, even life itself must be sacrificed,' he resolved with 'Then let me attain peace of mind' and recommenced his rigorous practice."
74,5,熊野へ參り、那智籠せんとしけるが、行の試みに、聞ゆる瀑に暫くうたれて見んとて、瀑下へぞ參りける。,"Traveling to Kumano, intending seclusion at Nachi Falls, he ventured beneath the falls out of curiosity after hearing tales of its power."
74,6,比は十二月十日餘の事なれば、雪降積り、つらゝいて、谷の小川も音もせず、峯の嵐吹凍り、瀑の白絲垂氷と成り、皆白妙に押竝べて、四方の梢も見え分かず。,"This occurred around December 10th when snow had piled heavily, freezing the mountain streams silent and still. The waterfall's spray crystallized into icy threads, everything blanketed in gleaming white so that even the distant peaks were obscured."
74,7,然るに文學瀑壺に下浸り、頸際漬て、慈救の咒を满けるが、二三日こそ有けれ、四五日にも成ければ、堪へずして文學浮あがりにけり。,"Nevertheless, the scholar submerged himself in the waterfall's basin, neck-deep, reciting the慈悲救 (mercy-saving) mantra. After two or three days - perhaps four or five - he could no longer endure and floated up."
74,8,数千丈り落る瀑なれば、なじかはたまるべき。,"For a waterfall that rises thousands of feet, one would naturally expect it to be treacherous."
74,9,さとおとされて、刀の刃の如くに、さしもき岩角の中を、浮沈、五六町こそ流れたれ。,"Swept away like a blade through jagged rock crevices, he bobbed and sank in the torrent for over five hundred meters."

74,13,文學少し人心地いできて、大の眼を見怒かし「我此瀑に三七日打れて、慈救の三洛叉の满うと思ふ大願有り。今日はに五日になる。七日だにも過ざるに、何者がへはとて來たるぞ。」と言ければ、見る人身の毛よだて物いはず。,"The scholar, now roused to anger, glared fiercely: 'I have vowed to endure this waterfall for twenty-one days to fulfill my great aspiration of reciting the three loka-sahasras (thousand-thousand) cycles of the慈悲救 mantra. Today is only the fifth day! Why has someone come here before I complete seven days?' This so terrified those who saw it that their hairs stood on end."
74,14,又瀑にり立て打れけり。,He returned to the falls' basin and recommenced his ordeal.
74,15,第二日と云に、八人の童子來て、引上んとし給へども、散々に抓合うて上らず。,"On the second day, eight children appeared attempting to pull him up, but he resisted their efforts."

74,17,瀑をさじとや、結うたる天童二人、瀑の上より下降り、文學が頂上より手足の爪さき手に至る迄、よにに香き御手を以て、下給ふとえければの心地して息出「抑如何なる人にてましませば、かうは給ふらん。」と問奉る。,"To avoid polluting the sacred falls, two celestial attendants with braided hair descended from above. Using hands warm as incense, they gently stroked the scholar's fingertips to his palms, so tenderly that he felt as if in a dream and could not catch his breath. 'What kind of beings are you,' he asked reverently, 'to show such compassion?'"
74,18,「我は是大不動明王の御使に、金迦、逝多伽と云ふ二童子也。文學無上の願を発して勇猛の行を企つ、行て力を合すべしと、明王のに依て、来れる也。」と答へ給ふ。,"'We are the two child messengers, Kingara and Sessaka, of the Great Saint Fudō Myō-ō. Per His Majesty's command, we have come to assist you in fulfilling your supreme vow through this rigorous practice.'"
74,19,文學を怒らかして、「さて明王は何くにましますぞ。」「兜率天に。」と答へて、井に上り給ひ。,"The scholar demanded in a raised voice: 'Where does the Myō-ō reside?' 'In Tushita Heaven,' they replied before ascending into distant clouds."
74,20,掌を合せて是を拜したてまつる。,"With palms pressed in reverence, he worshiped this wondrous sight."
74,21,「されば、我行をば、大不動明王までも知召れたるにこそ。」と、頼もしえて、瀑に立て打れけり。,"'Thus my practice has even been known to the Great Saint Fudō Myō-ō,' he resolved with renewed confidence, returning once more to the falls' basin."
74,22,に目出たき瑞相ども在ければ、吹來る風も身に入ず、落來る水もの如し。,"Truly miraculous signs appeared: the wind no longer chilled his body, and falling water felt as warm as hot springs."
74,23,かくて三七日の大願終に遂げにければ、那智に千日り、大三度、葛城二度、高野、粉川、金山、白山、立山、富士の、伊豆、箱根、信の戸、出羽の羽黒、じて日本國る所なく行て、さすが故やしかりけん、都へ上たりければ、凡そ飛も祈落す程の、やいばの者とぞ聞えし。,"After completing his twenty-one-day vow, he secluded himself for a thousand days at Nachi, climbed Mount Omine three times, Mount Katsuragi twice, and traversed all sacred sites throughout Japan - including Koya, Hasedera, Kinpusen, Hakusan, Tateyama, Fuji, Izu, Hakone, Tsumago in Shinano, Yudono in Dewa, and more. Though still pining for his homeland, upon returning to the capital, he became renowned as a wonder-worker whose prayers could even cause the mythical Haniwa (clay figurines) of Asuka to weep."

However, their fate will soon end—last August, he passed away. Now, between Minamoto and Taira, there is no general equal to the Shogun. Soon rebellion will rise, and Japan shall be handed over.' The Captain replied: 'How unexpected are Your Reverend's words! Having been saved by Lady Saijo-in at the cost of my life, I now only recite one Lotus Sutra daily to honor her memory.' The scholar then emphasized: 'Heaven bestows; if we reject it, we bear the blame. When the time comes and we act not, we incur disaster. Speaking thus is to discern Your Lordship's heart. See now the depth of His resolve!' Drawing a skull wrapped in white cloth from his sleeve."
77,1,兵衞佐殿、「あれは如何に。」と宣へば、「是こそわどのの父、故左馬頭殿の頭よ。平治の後、獄舎の前なる苔の下に埋れて、後世弔ふ人も無かりしを、文學存ずる旨有て、獄守に乞て此十餘年頸に懸け、山々寺々拜みまはり、弔ひ奉れば、今は定て一劫もたすかり給ぬらん。去れば、文學は故頭殿の御爲にも、奉公の者でこそ候へ。」と申ければ、兵衞佐殿、一定とは覺ねども、父の頭と聞く懷しさに、先涙をぞ流されける。,"The Captain asked, 'What is this?' The scholar replied: 'This is the skull of Wadono's father, late Lieutenant General. After the Heiji Rebellion, it was buried under moss near the prison. No one mourned him until I requested the guards to hang it for over a decade. We prayed at temples and mountains, and now it surely rests in peace. Indeed, as my duty to the late general...' Though understanding this, grief overwhelmed the Captain upon hearing 'father's skull,' and tears streamed first."
77,2,其後は打解て物語し給ふ。,Thereafter they continued their discourse.
77,3,「抑頼朝勅勘を許りずしては、爭か謀反をば起すべき。」と宣へば「それ易い事、やがて上て申許いて奉らん。」「さもさうず、御房も勅勘の身で人を申許さうと宣ふ、あてがひ様こそ、大に誠しからね。」「吾身の勅勘を許うと申さば,"'If we do not pardon Yoritomo's imperial reprimand, that is simple—immediately petition the court to absolve him. 'No! For Your Reverend"

77,11,実にも三日と云に、福原の新都へ上りつゝ前右兵衞督光能卿の許に、聊縁有ければ、其に行いて、「伊豆國の流人、前右兵衞佐頼朝こそ勅勘を許されて、院宣をだにも給はらば、八箇国の家人ども催し集めて、平家を亡し、天下を靜んと申候へ。」兵衞督、「いさとよ、我身も當時は三官共に停られて、心苦しい折節なり。法皇も押籠られて渡せ給へば、如何有んずらん。さりながら伺うてこそ見め。」とて、此由竊に奏せられければ、法皇やがて院宣をこそ下されけれ。,"On the third day, while ascending to Fukuhara's new capital, he visited General Mitsutaka Mitsunori, former Right Guard Commander: 'The exiled Izu noble Yoritomo, once pardoned, would gather eight provinces' retainers and overthrow the Heike to pacify the realm.' The general sighed: 'Agh! During my own confinement with the Three Ministers, how burdensome was that time. If the Cloistered Emperor is similarly confined...' Upon secretly reporting this, the Emperor soon issued the edict."
77,12,聖是を頸にかけ、又三日と云に伊豆國へ下り著く。,"With the decree around his neck, he descended to Izu after three more days."
77,13,兵衞佐「あはれ、此聖の御房は、なまじひに由なき事申し出して、頼朝又如何なる憂目にか逢んずらん。」と、思はじ事なう、あんじ續けて坐ける處に八日と云ふ午刻許に下著て、「すは院宣よ。」とて奉る。,"The Captain sighed: 'Alas! This Reverend has rashly spoken, inviting disaster upon Yoritomo.' Pondering this, at the eighth day's noon hour, he presented: 'Here is the imperial edict.'"
77,14,兵衞佐、院宣と聞く忝さに、手水鵜飼をし、新き烏帽子淨衣著て、院宣を三度拜して披かれけり。,"Honored to receive the edict, he performed hand-washing purification, donned new court cap and robe, then thrice bowed before unfolding it."

The court lady from the Imperial Concubine's attendants softly sang, 'The cricket's song gathering by the field,' her gentle melody finally persuading him to dismiss the guests and return."
78,10,其後又坐たりけるに、宮腹の女房「さても一日、何とて扇をば遣ひ止にしぞや。」ととはれければ、「いさ、かしがましなど聞え候しかば、さてこそ遣ひやみ候しか。」とぞ宣ひける。,"Later, when he again visited and she reproached him, 'Why discard your fan this very day?' he replied, 'Since I heard of your kindness, I naturally chose to abandon it.'"
78,11,彼女房の許より忠度の許へ、小袖一重遣すとて、千里の名殘の悲しさに、一首の歌をぞ、贈られける。,"In return, she sent a single-layered kimono sleeve to his quarters. Moved by the sorrow of separation, she composed this poem:"
78,12,东路の草葉をわけん袖よりも、たゝぬ袂の露ぞこぼるゝ。,"Though eastern grasses may be cut by sleeves, the dew on my hem alone shall fall."

78,18,承平天慶の蹤跡も、年久う成て准へ難しとて、今度は讃岐守正盛が、前対馬守源義親追討の爲に、出雲國へ下向せし例とて、鈴ばかり賜て、皮の袋に入て、雜色が頸に懸させてぞ下られける。,"Due to the passage of time since the Tenpyo-Tengyo era's precedents, this time Lord Masazumi of Sanuki Province was granted only bells in leather pouches, worn around the neck following the custom when Saneomi of Tsushima led an expedition against Minamoto no Yoshitomo."
78,19,古朝敵を滅さんとて、都をいづる將軍は、三つの存知有り。,"Historically, generals departing for war were admonished with three imperatives:"
78,20,節刀を賜はる日家を忘れ、家をいづるとて妻子を忘れ、戰場にして敵に鬪ふ時身を忘る。,"1) Forget home upon receiving the ceremonial sword,  
2) Forget family when leaving home,

""Along eight-nine days' march, fields mountains seas and rivers all brim with warriors. Though we estimate 400-500 in the rear guard, numbers beyond that are unknown. Yesterday at Kusigawa, scouts reported Minamoto forces numbering 200,000."" Upon hearing this, Tadakiyo lamented: 'Alas! If only we had acted sooner as His Majesty willed. Had we struck today, crossing Hakone Pass with our vanguard, the Hatakeyama and Otomo clans surely would have joined us. Then all Kanto's草木 would have bent to our will.' Yet regret proved futile."
78,50,又大將軍權亮少將維盛、東國の案内者とて、長井齋藤別當實盛を召て「やや實盛、汝程の強弓精兵、八箇国に如何程有ぞ。」と問ひ給へば、齋藤別當あざ笑て申けるは、「左候へば、君は實盛を大矢と思召し候か。,"Commander Norimori then summoned Yoshitsune of Nagai, his guide to the east: 'Tell me, Yoshitsune - how many skilled archers command your forces in Kanto?'

78,65,かう申せば、君を憶せさせ參せんとて申とや思召し候らん。,"Hearing this, you might recall our previous advice..."

78,67,軍は勢には依らず、策に依るとこそ申傳て候へ。,Remember - military success depends not on numbers but on strategy.
78,68,實盛今度の軍に命生て再都へ參るべしとも覺候はず。,Though I may survive this campaign to return to Kyoto...

78,70,さる程に、十月二十三日にもなりぬ。,Thus October 23rd arrived...
78,71,明日は源平富士川にて、矢合と定めたりけるに、夜に入て、平家の方より源氏の陣を見渡せば、伊豆駿河の人民百姓等が、軍に恐て、或は野に入り山に隱れ、或は舟に取乘て、海河に浮び、營の火見えけるを、平家の兵共「あなおびただしの源氏の陣の遠火の多さよ。げにも誠に野も山も海も河も、皆敵で有けり。如何せん。」とぞあわてける。,"Though tomorrow's battle at Fuji River had been decided, that night Taira scouts observed Minamoto campfires. Izu and Suruga villagers fled into fields or took to boats as the army's bonfires blazed across land and sea. The Taira forces gasped: 'Horrendous! Those distant flames suggest every inch of earth belongs to our enemies!'"
78,72,其夜の夜半ばかり、富士の沼に幾らもむれ居たりける水鳥共が、何にか驚きたりけん、只一度にはと立ける羽音の、大風雷などの樣に聞えければ、平家の兵共「すはやげんじの大勢の寄する是。<sentence>,"Midnight on October 23rd witnessed a strange phenomenon: countless waterfowl near Lake Fuji suddenly took flight, their wings beating like thunderstorm winds.

At that time, they had already been ordered to be executed. However, the new Minister of the Center, Chishinomaru, said: ""If the Emperor's fate is to end, even if one thousand people are beheaded, it would be difficult to take the world. How would their wives and children in their hometowns lament and grieve? If fate unexpectedly opens, and they are allowed to return to the capital, it would be a rare and precious favor. Only by distorting the reason should they be sent back to their homeland."" Upon hearing this, the Minister said, ""This reasoning is indeed correct,"" and gave them leave."

For the past two or three years, while the noise of Kyoto and the chaos of the provinces were upon us, I have not been able to attend to the affairs of my house, and yet I have not come to visit you. You have already sent him away from the capital. The fate of our family is now at an end. Upon hearing of the compilation of the imperial anthology, I thought that even a single poem would be enough to show my gratitude for your favor, and so I have been composing poems for a long time. But when the world became chaotic, and the matter was left unaddressed, I could only lament in solitude. If the world had remained peaceful, I would have surely received a commission for the anthology. In this collection of poems I have composed, if there is any poem that might be worthy, even a single one, I would be grateful to have received your favor, and I would be happy even in the shadow of the grass, as a distant guardian. Thus, at this time, I have brought this scroll, which contains over a hundred poems, including some that I considered particularly fine, and now I present it to you, having taken it from my armor."
110,3,三位是をあけて見て、「かゝる忘れ形見を給り置候ぬる上は、努々疎略を存ずまじう候。御疑あるべからず。さても只今の御渡りこそ情も勝れて深う、哀れも殊に思ひしられて感涙抑へ難う候へ。」と宣へば、薩摩守悦で「今は西海の浪の底に沈まば沈め、山野に尸をさらさばさらせ、浮世に思置く事候はず。さらば暇申て。」とて、馬に打乘り、甲の緒をしめ、西を指いてぞ歩せ給ふ。,"When the three Ministers opened it and saw it, he said, ""To have left behind such a token of remembrance is not something to be neglected. You need not doubt it. Indeed, your current departure is so deeply emotional, and your sorrow is especially profound, that it is difficult to hold back tears."" Upon hearing this, Satsuma no Kami was pleased and said, ""Now, if I were to sink to the bottom of the western sea, or if my body were to be scattered in the mountains and fields, I would no longer have anything to think of in this world. Then, I shall take my leave."" And so he mounted his horse, fastened his armor, and turned westward, walking away."

Tadamasa has returned. Though the gate has not been opened, I request that you allow me to stand here for a while."" Upon hearing this, Sanekage said, ""Indeed, if that is the case, he would not be a difficult person. Let him be admitted."" And so he opened the gate and they met face to face."
110,8,薩摩守忠度は、いづくよりか歸られたりけん、侍五騎、童一人、我身共に七騎取て返し、五條の三位俊成卿の宿所におはして見給へば門戸をとぢて開かず。,"Satzuma no Kami Tadamasa, from where had he returned? With five attendants, one boy, and himself, making seven in total, he returned and arrived at the residence of the three Ministers, Sanekage, at Gotō. When he approached, the doors were closed and would not open."
110,9,三位後を遙に見送て立たれたれば、忠度の聲と覺しくて、「前途程遠し、思を雁山の夕の雲に馳。」と、高らかに口ずさ,"When the three Ministers stood and watched him go, he heard Tadamasa's voice and said, ""How far the path lies ahead, my thoughts race like clouds at the evening of the wild goose mountain."" And he sang it aloud."
110,10,其後世靜て、千載集を撰ぜられけるに、忠度のありし有樣、言置し言の葉、今更思出て哀なりければ、彼の卷物の中に、さりぬべき歌幾らもありけれど、勅勘の人なれば、名字をば顯されず、「故郷花」といふ題にて詠まれたりける歌一首ぞ、讀人しらずと入られける。,"Later, when the world had calmed, when compiling the collection of a thousand years, thinking of Tadamasa's deeds and his words, they felt sorrowful and recalled them with regret. Though there were several poems in his collection that might have been worthy, since he was a person chosen by imperial decree, his name was not revealed, and only one poem, written under the title ""Old Country Flowers,"" was included in the collection, without anyone knowing who had composed it."
110,11,其身朝敵と成にし上は、仔細に及ばずと云ながら、恨めしかりし事共なり。,"Though it was said that he had become an enemy of the court, the details are not important, but these were things that caused resentment."

Though I am deeply sorry to part with such a treasured item, I fear it will become dust in the countryside. If by some miracle of fate I return to the capital, I shall entrust it to you again at that time."" As he spoke, he wept, and the Imperial Lady, moved by his sorrow, composed a poem."

Even amidst such a sudden and dramatic situation, thinking of his lingering presence, he summoned five or six attendants and hurried to Rinnō-ji Temple. At the gate, he dismounted from his horse and declared, ""The fortune of our house has ended, and today we have already departed from the imperial capital. The only thing I have left to remember in this world is your lingering presence. I began visiting at the age of eight, and until I came of age at thirteen, I had never left your side except for brief absences. From now on, heading westward toward the distant waves of the Western Sea, I cannot even imagine when or if I shall return.

When the chief of the Sōbu,贞敏 (Sadahitoshi), went to Tang China, he met the琵琶 master廉妾夫 (Renshōfu) of the great Tang dynasty, and received three pieces of music. These were passed down as three different styles: 玄象 (Genjō), 獅子丸 (Shishimaru), and 青山 (Aoyama).

Because I left one secret piece behind, I fell into the path of demons. Now, hearing the exquisite sound of the imperial琵琶, I have come here. I beg you to grant me the privilege of passing this piece to you, so that you may attain the fruit of enlightenment."""

There were halls for springs, halls for pine shade, halls for horse riding, two-tiered platforms, halls for viewing snow, halls for reeds, and many other halls built by the Minister of the Five Divisions, Lord Kiyomori. The eaves were covered with cranes, the walls with jade. All of them had been abandoned for three years, the old moss-covered paths blocked, the autumn grass gates closed."

I will go to the east and explain the details."" When he reached the great shrine of Atsuta in Owari Province, the palace official, Kōzō, who was waiting in the north, went to Owari Province and reported the matter, and the young lord, Yoshitsune, said, ""This is a matter that the palace official should go to the east.

Although I want to become the regent, I should become a monk. Well, then, I will become the chancellor."" When he said this, the official, Kōji, who had written a letter, said, ""The chancellor is the descendant of the great weaver's cap, the Fujiwara clan, and should be the one to become it. The lord is of the Minamoto clan and should not be the one to become it. It is not appropriate for the lord to become it."" ""It is beyond my power,"" he said, and was sent to the imperial stables."

This is also a famous horse that is not inferior."" And so, Kajiya was given the horse named Shusumi."

As they ascended with great effort, at the floating island of Suruga Province, Kajiya Noritada climbed to a high place and waited a while, observing the many horses. He saw the various saddles and reins, some pulled by the rider, others by the horse, and he could not count them, as they were innumerable. Among them, he thought that there was no horse better than the one given to him by Kajiya, and he was delighted. Then he saw a horse that looked like Ikesuki."
125,12,金覆輪の鞍置て、小總の鞦懸け、白沫かませ、舎人あまた附たりけれども、猶引もためず躍らせて出きたり。,"It had a golden-covered saddle, a small total reins, and a foaming horse, with many attendants. Yet it did not wait to be led, but leaped forward."

""It is Lord Sasaki's horse."" At that moment, Kajiya said, ""It is an untrustworthy one. If the same kind of horse that Kajiya had given to Sasaki was known to him, it would be a grudge. When he went up to the capital, he heard that the Four Heavenly Kings of Lord Kiso were the four men: Imai, Higuchi, Yari, and Nei. If he had formed a group with them and died, or if he had gone westward to fight with the Heike warriors who were said to be able to defeat a thousand men, I would think that it was a matter of fate. But with this appearance, it is not. Here, I will form a group with Sasaki and kill two good men, so that the Lord of the Heike will suffer a loss."""

Sasaki thought, ""I heard that this man secretly desired it."" He said, ""If you are going to take this important matter, then I will definitely take the bridge at Uji-Sedaya. There is no horse that can cross the river. I thought that if I said Ikesuki, you would not allow it. Since I heard that you would not allow it, and also because I thought that even if Takatada said it, you would not allow it, I thought that if there was any future judgment, I would rise at dawn, and with the help of my attendants, I would secretly steal the Ikesuki that was kept secret and go up. How could you do that?"" Kajiya was angry at these words and said, ""You are a despicable person. Then, I suppose Kajiya also stole it."" And with a laugh, he left."
125,22,既に美濃國伊勢國に著と聞えしかば、木曾大に驚き、宇治勢田の橋を引,"Since it was heard that he had already arrived in Mino and Ise provinces, Kiso was greatly surprised, and pulled back the bridge at Uji-Sedaya."

129,6,是を九郎御曹司に申す。,在御所奏报后被宽恕，但旁边的公卿和女官们说：“木曾将法住寺殿引来，制造喧嚣，使君主烦恼，放火焚烧，导致许多人丧生，但那时只有今井、樋口的声音存在。这些人都被宽恕，实在可惜。”于是再次被定为死罪。
129,7,僅六十日の内に替られ給へば、未だ見果ぬ夢の如し。,昔日的粟田关白，高兴之后只在七天内就去世。
129,8,樋口次郎は降人なりしが、頻に頸の伴せんと申ければ、藍摺の水干立烏帽子で渡されけり。,同日二十五日，樋口次郎最终未被斩杀。

129,14,岸高くして屏風を立たるに異ならず。,从北面山脚到南面海的浅滩，堆叠巨石，砍伐大树，倒置成逆茂木，深水处则放置大船。

129,19,出家入道をもして後世を弔ひ參せ給へ。,”如此说道，虽然樋口次郎是士兵，但命运已尽，最终在儿玉党中成为降人。
129,20,四塚に幾も馳向うたる敵の中へ馳入り、大音聲を揚て、「此御中に甲斐の一條次郎殿の御手の人やまします。」と問ければ、「強一條次郎殿の手で、軍をばするか、誰にも合へかし。」とて、どと笑ふ。,他冲入四塚中敌军之中，大声喊道：“在座各位中，有甲斐的一条次郎殿的部下吗？”
129,21,笑はれて名のりけるは、「かう申す者は信濃國諏訪上宮の住人、茅野大夫光家が子に、茅野太郎光廣、必ず一條の次郎殿の御手を尋るには非ず、弟の茅野七郎それにあり。光廣が子共二人信濃國に候が、あはれ我父は、好てや死にたるらん。惡てや死にたるらんと歎かん處に、弟の七郎が前で討死して、子共にたしかに聞せんと思ふ爲也。敵をば嫌まじ。」とて、あれに馳合ひ、これに馳合ひ、敵三騎きて落し、四人に當る敵に押雙べ引組でどうと落ち刺違てぞ死にける。,“由一条次郎殿亲自率领军队，谁敢与他交战？”于是大笑。
129,22,樋口次郎は兒玉黨に結ほれたりければ、兒玉の人ども寄合て、「弓矢取習ひ我も人も廣い中へ入らんとするは、自然の事の在ん時の一まとの息をも休め、暫しの命をも續んと思ふ爲也。されば樋口次郎が我等にむすぼほれけんも、さこそは思ひけめ。今度の我等が勳功には樋口が命を申請ん。」とて使者を立てゝ、「日比は木曾殿の御内に、今井、樋口とて聞え給しかども、今は木曾殿討れさせ給ひぬ。,被嘲笑后，他说道：“说我这话的是信浓国诹访上宫的居民，茅野大夫光家之子，茅野太郎光广，他并非一条次郎殿的部下，而是他的弟弟茅野七郎。光广的两个儿子在信浓国，我可怜父亲，不知是因喜好而死，还是因厌恶而死。弟弟七郎在前边战死，我想让儿子们听到这个消息。我并不憎恨敌人。”于是冲向敌人，与敌人交战，击落三骑，与四人交战时被压制，最终被刺死。
129,23,何か苦かるべき、我等が中へ降人に成給へ。,因为樋口次郎与儿玉党结盟，儿玉党的人聚集在一起说：“我们学习弓箭，进入广阔战场，这是自然的事。我们即使暂时休息，也希望能延续生命。因此，虽然樋口次郎与我们结盟，但我想，这次我们的功勋应由樋口的生命来申请。”于是派出使者说：“日比在木曾殿的内院，听说今井、樋口等，但如今木曾殿已让他们讨伐。
129,24,勳功の賞に申かへ,我们之中有人成为降人，将功勋申请为生命。

129,29,されば木曾左馬頭、先都へ入といふとも、頼朝朝臣の命に從がはましかば、彼,并不逊色于那位先帝的谋略。
129,30,傳に聞く、虎狼の國衰て諸侯蜂の如く起し時、,虽然有人声称先入咸阳宫，但项羽后来到来，因此他妻子未被侵犯，金银珠宝未被掠夺，只是守卫函谷关，逐渐消灭敌人，最终治理天下。
129,31,範頼義經樣々に申されけれども、「今井、樋口、楯、根井とて、木曾が四天王の其一つ也。是等を宥められんは、養虎の愁有るべし。」と、殊に沙汰有て斬られけるとぞ聞えし。,传说中，当虎狼之国衰落，诸侯如蜂群般崛起时。
129,32,同廿五日、樋口次郎終に斬られぬ。,尽管范赖和义经多次申述，但“今井、樋口、楯、根井都是木曾的四天王之一。这些人被宽恕，就像养虎为患。”于是特别下令斩杀。

129,40,今井が兄樋口次郎兼光は、十郎藏人討んとて、河内國長野城へ越たりけるが、其にては討漏しぬ。,今井的兄长樋口次郎兼光为了讨伐十郎藏人，前往河内国长野城，但在那里却未能成功讨伐。
129,41,「あな心憂、是は何地へとて渡せ給ひ候ぞ。君は討れさせ給ぬ。今井殿は自害。」と申ければ、樋口次郎涙をはら／＼と流いて、「是聞給へ、殿原、君に御志思ひ參せ給はん人人は、是より何地へも落行き、出家入道して、乞食頭陀の,“啊，你心中忧愁，这是要去哪里渡河呢？你无法讨伐敌人。今井殿已经自尽。”如此说道，樋口次郎泪流满面，“请听我说，殿原，那些心怀君主意志而参战的人，从此将无处可去，只能出家修行，成为乞食头陀。

They said, ""Even though we have served the Hōjō until yesterday and today, we will not be of any use if we now go to the Minamoto. Let us shoot an arrow at the Hōjō and then go face them."" Thus, the Minister of the Left, Kōno no Chūnagon, his son, the Third Rank of Echizen, and the Governor of Echigo, three father and son, heard that the people of Bizen Province had settled in Shimotsu, so they prepared to attack with ten or more warships."

Then Lord Nine郎 declared, ""What about the example of the large torches?"" Tsuchiya Jirō replied, ""That is indeed the case,"" and then set fire to the homes of the local residents at Onosawa."
132,9,其夜の戌の刻ばかり、九郎御曹司、土肥次郎を召て、「平家は是より三里隔てて、三草山の西の山口に、大勢で引へたんなるは今夜夜討によすべきか、明日の軍か」と宣へば、田代冠者進み出でて申けるは、「明日の軍と延られなば、平家勢附候なんず。平家は三千餘騎、御方の御勢は一萬餘騎、遙の利に候。夜討好んぬと覺候。」と申ければ、土肥次郎、「いしうも申させ給ふ田代殿哉。さらば軈て寄せさせ給へ。」とて打立けり。,"At the hour of the dog in the night, Lord Nine郎, summoning Tsuchiya Jirō, said, ""The Heike are three li away at the western mountain pass of Mount Sasaki, and they have gathered in large numbers. Should we attack them tonight with a night raid or wait until tomorrow's battle?""

He strongly advised him, but Takaguchi replied, ""The Western Queen Mother, whom I have heard of, existed in the past but not now. Eastern朔, whom I have heard of, is only known by name and not seen with the eyes. In a world where youth and old age are uncertain, it is no different from the flicker of a stone fire. Even if people live long lives, they rarely pass seventy or eighty. Within that time, the period of glory is only about twenty years. In this dreamlike world, how long should one look upon something ugly? If you wish to see what you love, it is like betraying your father's life. This is good advice. Therefore, I despise this world and will enter the true path."" At the age of nineteen, he cut his hair and went to the monastery of Ōsaka's Ōjō-in, where he stayed."

If you would allow me to see you once more, even if your appearance has changed."" Hearing this, Takaguchi, the monk, struck his chest in agitation, peered through the gap in the shoji screen, and realized the truth of his search.

I felt the deep longing in my heart, and even the Ministers, the Second Rank, thought that I had two minds, like the Minister of the Left, and thus kept me apart. How pitiable is my fate! I could not help but leave them behind. I had long wished to ascend the mountain path to the capital once more to see those I love, but because of my regret for the Third Rank General, it did not come to pass.

The open sea will surely blow strongly. We should proceed despite the wind."" The Judge was greatly angered and declared, ""It is all the karma of those who have fallen into the mountains and rivers, and those who drown in the sea. When you are on the sea, how can you expect the wind to be gentle? If you say you will cross against the wind, it is a foolish thing. If the wind is favorable, even if it is a little strong, you must not say it is too dangerous to cross. If the ships are not prepared, I shall have each one shot down one by one."""

The Judge asked, ""What are reverse oars?"" Kajiwara replied, ""If you think of a horse galloping, it is easy to turn it to the archers or the horsemen. For a ship, it is important to reverse, so if you raise oars at the bow and stern, and put in the paddles, it will be easy for anyone to push it forward."" The Judge declared, ""If you think of the army as something that should not be pulled, it is a bad habit. Pulling is the usual practice."""

165,23,何れ劣れりとも見,It was not clear which side was superior.
165,24,えず。,"However, the Heike side had the Ten Virtues of the Emperor, the Three Sacred Treasures, and had passed them over. The Genji side, thinking of this, was worried, but for a while, they thought it was a cloud, floating in the sky, but it was not a cloud. A white flag with no master flowed down, and it was visible at the stern of the Genji ships, as long as the string of the bamboo pole."

The Judge thought her most admirable. Though the Minister of the Left had a daughter, the daughter of the former Lord of Kawagoe, Shigemasa, he treated this lady differently, placing her in a special position."

It was only because Yoritomo carefully planned and raised his army that the Heike were so easily destroyed. It would not have been enough for the Nine-Lord alone to pacify the world.

Though there are many people, none have become the son-in-law of the Minister of the Left, nor have they been accepted by him. Furthermore, none have risen to prominence in the world, nor have they taken the Minister of the Left as their father-in-law.

His mother gave birth to him, but after that, she was distressed and eventually passed away. She said, 'No matter whose womb you place the child in, do not forget me, and raise him as my heir. Do not send him to the nurse's care.' Because of the inconvenience of this, she said, 'When we defeat the enemy, let the Right Minister be the general, and let this child be the deputy general.' Thus, the child was named deputy general, and the Right Minister, thinking it a happy thing, called him by name and cherished him until the end of his days. But seven days later, he passed away without a grave. Every time I see this child, I cannot help but remember this sorrowful tale.""

I cannot bear to part from you, my beloved. Among those captured alive was a child of eight years old who had been attached to you. I wonder if he is still alive in this world. I would like to see him once more."" Upon receiving this, the Judge replied: ""If it is indeed true that you cannot bear to part from me, then truly I feel the same. Please send the child who was entrusted to the care of Kōgō no Shōtaro Shigekata to my residence."" Then, borrowing a carriage, the child was taken and accompanied by two ladies-in-waiting, all riding in one carriage, and arrived at the Minister's residence."
173,25,かくて時刻遙に推し移りければ河越小太郎重房涙をおさへて、「今はいかに思食され候とも叶はせ給ひ候まじ。とう／＼。」と申ければ其時乳母の懷の中より、引出し奉り、腰の刀にて押伏て終に頸をぞ掻いてける。,"Thus, after a long time had passed, Judge Kōgō no Shōtaro Shigekata, holding back his tears, said, ""No matter how much you wish for it, it cannot be done.

The young lord is to remain in Kyoto. Since Shigekata has been ordered to retire, the matter will be handed over to Lord Awata no Saburō Noriyoshi. He will be summoned soon."" Then, when the carriage was brought, the young lord climbed in without hesitation."
173,31,大臣殿、「如何に是へ。」と宣へば、やがて御膝の上に參り給ふ。,"The Minister said, ""How is this?"" and the young lord soon approached and sat on his knees."

174,5,道すがらも餘りに心細げにおはしければ、判官情ある人にて、樣々に慰め奉る。,"Since the Minister's Lord and his son were feeling very anxious along the way, the Judge, being a compassionate person, comforted them in various ways."
174,6,判官、思はれけるは「去年の正月木曾義仲を追討せしよりこのかた一谷壇浦に至るまで命を棄てゝ平家を責め落し、内侍所、璽の御箱事故なく返入奉り、大將軍父子生捕にして、具して是迄下りたらんには、縱如何なる不思議ありとも、一度はなどか對面なかるべき。凡は九國の惣追捕使にも成され、山陰山陽南海道、いづれにても預け、一方の固めともなされんずるとこそ思ひつるに、わづかに伊豫の國ばかりを知行すべき由仰せられて、あまさへ鎌倉へだにも入られぬこそ本意なけれ。さればこは何事ぞ。日本國を靜むる事、義仲義經が爲態にあらずや。譬へば同じ父が子で、先に生るるを兄とし、後に生るるを弟とする計なり。誰か天下を知らんに知らざるべき。剩今度見參をだにも遂げずして逐ひ上らるゝこそ遺恨の次第なれ。謝する所を知らず。」とつぶやかれけれども力なし。,"The Judge thought to himself, ""Since last January when I pursued and defeated Moronao Yoshinaka, until now, reaching this place from Ichinotani to Dan-no-ura, I have sacrificed my life to bring down the Heike. I returned the imperial seal without incident, captured the general and his son alive, and descended here. Even if there is any strange fate, surely I should have met them once. I was appointed as the overall commander of the nine provinces, and I was entrusted with the regions of Yamashina, Yamaguchi, and the southern route. However, I was only given the domain of Iyo and was not allowed to enter Kamakura at all. Thus, this is not my intention. So, what is this? Is it not because of Yoshinaka and Yoshitsune that Japan is now at peace? It is like the case of two brothers, the older one being the elder brother and the younger one the younger brother. Who does not know the world? It is only because I did not complete this visit and was driven away that I feel regret."""
174,7,大臣殿、判官に向て「相構、今度親子の命を助けて給へ。」と宣ば、「遠き國、遙の島へも遷しぞ參せ候はんずらん。御命失ひ奉るまではよも候はじ。縱さ候とも、義經が勳功の賞に申かへて、御命計は助參せ候べし。御心安う思食され候へ。」と憑もしげに申されければ「たとひ夷が千島なりともかひなき命だにあらば。」と宣ひけるこそ口惜けれ。,"The Minister's Lord said to the Judge, ""I beg you, this time, save the lives of my father and son."" He continued, ""Even if they are to be exiled to a distant land or a remote island, I will not allow them to lose their lives. Even if they are to be punished, I will plead for their lives on account of the merits of Yoshitsune. Please be at ease in your heart."" Upon hearing this, the Judge replied, ""Even if they were to be sent to the land of the夷, if their lives are not spared, it would be regrettable."""

The reason is that if Yoshitsune did not fall from the mountain above Ichinotani, it would be difficult to break through the eastern and western gateways. Whether alive or dead, Yoshitsune should be captured, but instead, the Prince of the Palace has been looked upon. Therefore, the Third Rank Middle General should be sent to Tsuchi. However, since Kiyomori had united his heart with Tsuchi, the Third Rank Middle General was entrusted to Tsuchi's younger son, and thus, it was quietened."" Upon hearing this, the Lord of Kamakura nodded and said, ""Today, when Nine郎 enters Kamakura, everyone should prepare."" Immediately, the great and small lords gathered, and soon there were several thousand riders."
174,12,鎌倉殿は隨兵七重八重に居ゑ置いて我身は其中におはしながら「九郎はすゝどきをのこなれば此疊の下よりも這出んずる者也。但し頼朝はせらるまじ。」とぞ宣ひける。,"The Lord of Kamakura was stationed among the sevenfold and eightfold ranks of soldiers, while he himself was in the middle, saying, ""Nine郎 has left behind a trace, so he will emerge from beneath this mat.

The messenger, Tōjō Yoshie, was sent with the message: ""The people of the Heike are thinking of something different. The reason is that, no matter how the nun of the Pond Palace might have said, the monk would not have allowed it. Therefore, Minamoto no Yoritomo should have fought for it. The fact that he was forgiven and sentenced to exile was the monk's grace. Therefore, for over twenty years, he had indeed repented, but when the imperial court issued an order to pursue him as a traitor, he could not have defied the imperial decree, and because of his lack of strength, he had to come to the court. This was his true intention."""
175,6,偏に念佛をのみぞ申給ふ。,"Since the Judge was a man of deep feelings, he had sent people ahead of him three days before the journey, and had requested the holy monk Hōnen Shōhō of Dainen Temple."
